        "title": "Indian youth turning to loans for ambition, not necessity",
        "content": "Recent data suggests a remarkable shift in borrowing habits among young Indians: loans are increasingly being taken not out of urgent financial need, but to fulfil aspirationsfrom career goals to lifestyle upgrades. Several surveys and industry reports indicate the rise of whatâs being termed âpurpose-basedâ or âaspiration-ledâ borrowing.\n\nHistorically, loans in India have largely been used for essential needs, emergencies, healthcare, home repairs, or education. But a recent nationwide survey done bya consumer finance companyreveals a different trend among youth: many are now borrowing to support ambitions such as starting a business, upskill via courses or even fund lifestyle expenditures, seeing credit as a tool to achieve long-term goals rather than just manage short-term crises.\n\nBorrowers are becoming more âtech-savvyâ, using online platforms to compare credit products, plan repayment schedules and align loans with specific personal or professional projects, indicating a maturing credit culture, particularly among younger, urban borrowers comfortable with digital financial tools.\n\nThis evolution from need-based to purpose-based borrowing has multiple implications. For individuals, it signals growing confidence in using structured credit to advance life ambitionsÂ  perhaps reflecting a broader mindset shift among the young generation toward leveraging debt for upward mobility. At the same time, it may also indicate comfort with risk, as not all aspirational investments, business ventures, skill courses, lifestyle upgrades, guarantee stable returns or value retention.\n\nFor lenders and the broader credit-finance ecosystem, this trend opens up new markets. Financial institutions can design new loan products: flexible repayment plans, project-based loans, or education and career-focused credit lines. It also suggests increasing demand for financial literacy, as borrowers making âpurpose-basedâ loans may need clearer guidance on budgeting, interest rates, and debt-servicing capacity.\n\nThe rise of aspiration-led borrowing among youth comes at a time of expanding digital finance infrastructure in India with easier access to online credit platforms, digital wallets, and fintech lenders. This environment lowers the barrier to entry for younger borrowers seeking small to mid-sized loans for non-essential purposes.\n\nMoreover, such borrowing behaviour might reflect changing socio-economic aspirations, a growing belief in self-improvement, entrepreneurship, and lifestyle enhancement among younger Indians. As more young people venture into startups, upskilling, or consumption-led lifestyles, structured credit becomes a tool to bridge ambition with access.\n\nHowever, experts warn that without adequate financial planning and regulation, aspiration-driven borrowing may lead to over-leverage. If a borrower fails to derive expected returns (say from a new venture or course), loan defaults can rise, impacting both individuals and lenders. This calls for strengthened consumer awareness, better financial education, and responsible lending practices tailored to younger demographics.\n\nCyclone Ditwah killed 56 in Sri Lanka and is set to make landfall in India on Sunday.

        "title": "India beats expectations to grow at 8.2% in July-September quarter",
        "content": "India beat expectations to grow at 8.2 per cent in the July-September quarter on the back of strong manufacturing and services sector, according to official government data released on Friday.\n\nA poll by CNBC-TV 18 had projected the quarterly growth at 7.4 per cent.\n\nBut the economy grew more than expected on the back of strong secondary (8.1 per cent) and tertiary (9.2 per cent) sectors’ growth. This is the fastest growth in six quarters.\n\nIn a post on X, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed the quarterly growth as a reflection of “hard work and enterprise of our people” and appreciated the government’s reforms.\n\nThe 8.2% GDP growth in Q2 of 2025-26 is very encouraging. It reflects the impact of our pro-growth policies and reforms. It also reflects the hard work and enterprise of our people. Our government will continue to advance reforms and strengthen Ease of Living for every citizen.\n\nIn the secondary sector, manufacturing grew at 9.1 per cent and construction at 7.2 per cent. In the tertiary sector, financial, real estate, and professional services (10.2 per cent) sustained a substantial growth rate.\n\nThe strong economic growth could fuel annual growth to 7.5 per cent, which would be above the government and Reserve Bank’s projections, according to Garima Kapoor, Deputy Head of Research and Economist at Elara Capital.\n\nKapoor told CNBC TV-18, âThe blockbuster GDP growth has been led by front-loading of exports along with strong government spending, especially capex, amid a supportive base effect. With todayâs print, full-year FY26 GDP growth will now see an upside and will be close to 7.5 per cent â way above RBIâs and governmentâs estimate.â\n\nNotably, the strong growth has been reported in the midst of American tariffs â India faces 50 per cent American tariffs, the highest in the world.\n\nIrrespective of India frontloading shipments in the wake of tariffs and other technical measures that could have frontloaded economic activity, India has had a good year and is expected to be the fastest-growing major economy.\n\n“Even after accounting for these technical factors, growth performance in Q2 FY26âand for the first half overallâhas been materially stronger than anticipated. With real GDP expanding 8 per cent in H1 [first half], full-year growth is now likely to exceed our earlier estimate of 7 per cent, even if activity moderates slightly in the remainder of the year. India is set to retain its position as the fastest-growing major economy globally,” said Sujan Hajra, the Chief Economist and Executive Director of Anand Rathi Group, told CNBC-TC 18.\n\nCyclone Ditwah killed 56 in Sri Lanka and is set to make landfall in India on Sunday.

        "title": "Who is Bandhu Maan Singh Sekhon? Gangster linked to firing at Kapil Sharma’s Canada café arrested",
        "content": "The Delhi Police Crime Branch has arrested Bandhu Maan Singh Sekhon, a figure with alleged ties to organised crime networks spanning India and Canada, in connection with the series of gunfire attacks on comedian Kapil Sharmaâs Kaps Cafe in Surrey, British Columbia.\n\nInvestigators accuse him of overseeing logistics, providing weapons, and coordinating movements linked to the shooters who repeatedly targeted the establishment earlier this year.\n\nHis arrest follows months of international coordination between agencies examining patterns of cross-border criminal activity involving the Goldy Dhillon gang, a syndicate long associated with extortion, targeted violence, and arms trafficking.\n\nThe breakthrough came when Canadian investigators managed to trace a vehicle connected to one of the firing incidents.\n\nAround the same time, Sekhon reportedly left Canada and entered India during August, coinciding with the investigation in Surrey.\n\nShortly after, Delhi Police took down an arms-smuggling network whose members disclosed, during interrogation, that they had delivered weapons to Sekhon in Ludhiana.\n\nThese statements provided the Crime Branch with the first concrete indication that he was operating from within India and played a larger role than previously understood.\n\nIntelligence units began surveillance operations in Punjab with the aim of locating him.\n\nAfter tracking his movements for days, police conducted a late-night raid in Ludhiana on November 25, where they apprehended Sekhon and recovered a PX-3 semi-automatic pistol of Chinese make and eight cartridges from his vehicle.\n\nThe Delhi Police Crime Branch has arrested Bandhu Man Singh, a gangster, in connection with the conspiracy to fire at Kapil Sharma's restaurant in Canada. He is a prominent criminal of the Goldy Dhillon gang and has several criminal cases registered against him. A Chinese pistolâ¦pic.twitter.com/6idFvdyp5r\n\nAuthorities from the Crime Branch described him as someone deeply embedded in the logistical structure of the gang.\n\nDelhi Police officials revealed that Sekhonâs association with organised crime began after his move to Canada several years ago.\n\nAccording to Joint CP Crime Branch Surender Kumar, Sekhon initially went abroad on a work visa, taking up jobs in different establishments before coming into contact with extremist circles.\n\nAs Kumar explained, âHe went to jail in some cases and developed links with extremists there. After that, he began working with them.â\n\nHis criminal footprint reportedly expanded during his stay in the country, with multiple cases registered against him for firearms-related offences and extortion-linked activities.\n\nDCP Crime Branch Sanjeev Kumar Yadav confirmed that investigators had encountered his name earlier in an arms-trafficking case, stating, âAfter apprehending him, we learned that he is a Canada-based gangster involved in several firing and extortion cases there and was even arrested in Canada.â\n\nBeyond official criminal charges, an online video circulating on social media shows Sekhon firing multiple rounds from what appears to be a shotgun in a snowy region believed to be in Canada.\n\nIn the clip, he is seen wearing a biker jacket and spectacles as he discharges the weapon while recording himself.\n\nPolice also disclosed that before joining the Dhillon network, he briefly had associations with the Harry Chatha gang, an outfit whose leader â currently linked with Pakistanâs ISI â is accused of threatening and extorting members of the South Asian diaspora in North America.\n\nThis indicates that Sekhonâs entry into organised crime may have preceded his involvement with the Dhillon faction and was shaped over years of exposure to criminal elements abroad.\n\nInvestigators have stated that Sekhon became a trusted figure within the Goldy Dhillon gang, eventually taking on responsibilities that required coordination across borders.\n\nHe allegedly arranged vehicles, facilitated weapons transfers, and acted as an intermediary for overseas operatives.\n\nHe is also suspected of trying to revive sections of the gangâs network in India after returning from Canada. Police believe he was responsible for arranging sophisticated firearms, with officers citing earlier seizures in Delhi that included imported pistols such as the PX-5.7 and PX-3 models.\n\nDuring questioning, arrested gang members Mandeep Singh and Dalvinder Kumar reportedly mentioned that one of the seized pistols had been delivered to Sekhon. These statements provided investigators with additional confirmation of his involvement in illegal arms procurement.\n\nAuthorities also noted that after the Surrey Police increased their crackdown in Canada late this summer, making arrests among the attackersâ local associates, Sekhon abruptly left Canada on August 23.\n\nThis departure coincided with the timeline of the second attack on the cafÃ© and occurred shortly before he resurfaced in India. His movement suggested to investigators that he may have been aware of impending arrests abroad, prompting him to flee the country.\n\nOfficials now believe that Sekhon acted as a crucial logistics coordinator for shooters in Canada, including individuals identified by Canadian authorities as Daljot Rehal and Gurjot, who were allegedly working under the direction of Dhillonâs close aide Seepu.\n\nPolice say the shooters operated under detailed instructions from overseas gang leaders, and Sekhon was the point of contact responsible for connecting operations in both countries.\n\nKapil Sharmaâs cafÃ© in Surrey, known as âKaps Cafe,â has beensubjected to repeated targeted firing incidents.The attacks occurred on:\n\nEach incident involved unidentified individuals opening fire at the premises, either from a vehicle in motion or from the roadside.\n\nWhile no injuries were recorded, all incidents resulted in property damage and raised security concerns.\n\nResponsibility claims for the attacks have come from multiple individuals within overlapping criminal networks.\n\nAfter the October shooting, a man identified as Kulvir Sidhu, reportedly with links to the Lawrence Bishnoi group, released a video claiming involvement.\n\nIn the clip, he said, âTodayâs firing at Caps Cafe, Surrey was carried out by me, Kulvir Sidhu, Goldy Dhillonâ¦ Bollywood individuals who speak against our religion should also be prepared, bullet can come from anywhere.â\n\nEarlier, Khalistani-affiliated figureHarjit Singh Laddi had claimed responsibilityfor the July incident, citing dissatisfaction with alleged remarks on Sharmaâs television programme.\n\nGangster Goldy Dhillon himself also claimed involvement in the attack at a later stage.\n\nKapil Sharma,addressing the matter during a press conferenceon November 26, expressed frustration at the repeated shootings and the inability of local authorities to prevent them.\n\nHe stated, âThere were three firing incidentsâ¦and I think maybe the police there donât have enough power to control such things. But when our case happened, it was taken up at the deferral levelâ¦discussed in the Canadian Parliament.â\n\nThe string of attacks has prompted deeper inquiries into whether prominent Indian entertainers abroad are being increasingly targeted by foreign-based gangs as part of their extortion strategies.\n\nOfficials have also indicated that the case has opened avenues for inquiries into possible funding channels, additional associates, and operations involving other regions targeted by the gang.\n\nImran Khan's family demands proof of life amid death rumors.

        "title": "What does India's new seismic map say about earthquakes risk in your city?",
        "content": "India has unveiled a dramatically revised seismic zonation map as part of the new Earthquake Design Code, placing the entire Himalayan arc into a newly created highest-risk Zone VI for the first time.\n\nThe update significantly alters the countryâs understanding of earthquake hazards, showing that 61 per cent of India is now classified as having moderate to high seismic risk, an assessment that will reshape how buildings, infrastructure, and expanding cities plan for the deep tectonic forces beneath some of the most densely populated parts of the subcontinent.\n\nVineet Gahalaut, director of the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology and former head of the National Centre for Seismology, told theTimes of Indiathat the updated map finally establishes consistent treatment of the Himalayan corridor, which was previously divided between Zones IV and V despite being governed by the same tectonic drivers.\n\nHe noted that older maps underestimated the danger posed by long-quiet fault sections, particularly the central Himalaya, which has not produced a major surface rupture in nearly 200 years.\n\nExperts consider this revision one of the most consequential updates to Indiaâs seismic risk framework in decades. The changes reclassify the outer Himalaya as a region where future ruptures are expected to propagate southward until meeting the Himalayan Frontal Thrust, beginning near Mohand in the Dehradun sector, a modification that senior scientists toldTOIfinally aligns hazard levels with geological reality rather than administrative borders.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS), which released the updated zonation under the revised Earthquake Design Code, explained that the mapping is based on globally recognised probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA) techniques. These methods account for active fault characteristics, maximum potential earthquake magnitudes, how shaking decreases with distance, tectonic regimes, and subsurface geology.\n\nThis replaces the older system, which leaned heavily on past earthquake epicentres, broad geological traits and soil categories, and historical damage surveysâan approach that sometimes led to hazard adjustments near industrial hubs or major cities without sufficiently considering the seismic capacity of individual faults.\n\nBIS said the updated zonation offers a clearer picture of the peak ground accelerations that future earthquakes may generate, urging engineers and planners to adopt the 2025 map rather than the 2016 version to ensure construction reflects current hazard levels. This shift is especially important given that nearly 75 per cent of Indiaâs population now lives in seismically active regions, and the proportion of land in moderate to high hazard zones has risen from 59 per cent to 61 per cent.\n\nThe new code brings major upgrades to safety requirements for both structural and non-structural components, with the latter receiving serious attention for the first time. Elements such as ceilings, parapets, overhead tanks, faÃ§ade panels, lifts, electrical lines, and suspended fixtures often fail even when the main structure remains intact.\n\nUnder the revised rules, all heavy non-structural components exceeding 1 per cent of a buildingâs total weight must be properly anchored and braced to reduce internal collapses and limit injuries during moderate earthquakes, an improvement engineers say will prevent many avoidable casualties.\n\nCritical infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, pipelines, bridges, and key public buildings, must now be designed to remain operational after a major earthquake so they can support disaster response. Engineers say this aligns India with international best practices that prioritise resilience of essential services, not just the survival of the physical structure.\n\nWhile the Himalayan region underwent sweeping reclassification under the revised map, the southern peninsula saw only minor scientific refinements. Its overall hazard assessment remains largely unchanged due to the comparatively stable tectonic conditions in the south.\n\nInvestigators found Muzammil Ganaie rented multiple hideouts near Al-Falah University. One hideout was a three-bedroom house rented under the pretext of a Kashmiri fruit business. Explosives were reportedly stored in a smaller room on a farmer's land, later moved to Fatehpur Taga.\n\nGet the latest stories delivered straight to your inbox.",

        "content": "Investigators probing the 10 November car blast in Delhi have uncovered that one of the primary suspects rented multiple hideouts in Faridabad, all in the vicinity ofAl-Falah University, sources toldPTI.\n\nThe suspect, Muzammil Ganaieâarrested earlier in connection with the alleged âwhite-collar terror moduleâ behind the attackâis now found to have used at least two additional properties besides his known accommodations in Dhauj and Fatehpur Taga, police sources disclosed.\n\nAccording to the investigation, one of the newly identified hideouts was a three-bedroom house rented from the former sarpanch of Khori Jamalpur village. The house, situated roughly 4 km from Al-Falah University, comprised a hall, kitchen and three bedrooms, and was rented on the pretext of starting a Kashmiri fruit business.\n\nâHe had come with a woman doctor and said he needed space to trade Kashmiri fruit,â said the former sarpanch (head of village), whose property was let out to Muzammil. The suspect stayed there between April and July 2025 at a monthly rent of Rs 8,000. The landlord added that Muzammil vacated after about three months, claiming the house was âtoo hot,â and left 15 daysâ rent unpaid.\n\nAlso read |Hearing loss, trauma... How Delhi blast victims are suffering\n\nIn addition to this house, investigators discovered a smaller room built on a farmerâs land,Â  another hideout where explosives and materials were reportedly stored. The probe suggests that the suspect shifted explosive material from this farm-site to a house in Fatehpur Taga village, possibly to prepare for or time attacks.\n\nAccording to officials, the unfolding revelations have expanded the scope of the investigation. A team from the National Investigation Agency (NIA) recently visited the village and questioned the house owner for several hours.\n\nThe discovery of multiple hideouts near a university campus has renewed concerns over how educational institutions and surrounding areas may have been exploited to facilitate terror plotting. The development also complicates efforts to map thefull extent of the network, including collaborators or enablers who may have helped secure properties, rental agreements, or mobility.\n\nPM Modi inaugurated Skyrootâs Infinity Campus in Hyderabad and unveiled Vikram-I, India's first private orbital rocket. Vikram-I, built by Skyroot, can place payloads of around 300 kg in low earth orbit and features 3D-printed liquid engines. Skyroot aims to launch Vikram-I later this year after completing various stages of testing across India.\n\nGet the latest stories delivered straight to your inbox.",

        "content": "The Supreme Court has asked the Information and Broadcasting Ministry to formulate an “effective” mechanism to regulate user-generated content (UGC), involving the screening of such content before they are made public.\n\nThe court noted that its directive is not meant to “throttle” users but to create a “sieve” so the legal gap is bridged in terms of accountability for content uploaded on online platforms.\n\nA bench consisting of CJI Surya Kant and Justice Joymalya Bagchi said, “This is something very strange that I create my own platform and channel but there is no accountability. There must be a sense of responsibility attached to such content.”\n\nThe matter stemmed from a petition filed by podcaster Ranveer Gautam Allahbadia, who sought protection from several complaints linked to his vulgar comments on the YouTube showIndiaâs Got Latent. In March, the court directed the Centre to issue guidelines for regulating obscene or undignified speech on such platforms.\n\nThe bench highlighted that content regulation is necessary in cases of “anti-national” posts that are meant to create unrest in society. “Right to freedom of speech is very important but a regulated right. It is not absolute as the First Amendment Rights in the US. Self-regulatory codes may not work in case of UGC. If anti-national content is uploaded on social media, by the time the govt notices it and orders its takedown, a day or two may pass, during which period it would go viral and cause damage to, or unrest in, society,â it said.\n\nThe court has also proposed an age-verification system linked with the Aadhaar card to ensure that minors are not exposed to explicit or sensitive content on social media platforms. It also questioned the relevance of the one-line disclaimer that viewers are shown before objectionable content starts playing.\n\n“We will not approve of a mechanism that will gag expression of views or freedom of speech. We are on a reasonable preventive mechanism, not to throttle but sieve content on social media prior to uploading. AI provides enormous potential to curate content. Some content may be academic yet… scurrilous. Today there is a statutory vacuum in this regard which needs to be filled,” the court added.\n\nThe court noted that the guidelines would be implemented experimentally, and warned that if they are used to silence individuals, it would decline to grant final approval.\n\n“âWe may leave it to the government to frame the regulations but to have a preventive mechanism is not to throttle anyone but to have a sieve. Today, technology run with Artificial Intelligence has made users enormously powerful,â it said.\n\nInvestigators found Muzammil Ganaie rented multiple hideouts near Al-Falah University. One hideout was a three-bedroom house rented under the pretext of a Kashmiri fruit business. Explosives were reportedly stored in a smaller room on a farmer's land, later moved to Fatehpur Taga.\n\nGet the latest stories delivered straight to your inbox.",

        "title": "Explained: Vikram-I, the country’s first private rocket unveiled by PM Modi",
        "content": "In the global space race, India just received a boost up, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated Indian space startup Skyrootâs Infinity Campus in Hyderabad as well as unveiled Vikram-I, the countryâs first private orbital rocket.\n\nSpeaking at the event, PM Modi said that todayâs space ecosystem, private sector was emerging with flying colours. âIndiaâs private space talent is making its own identity in the world. Today, Indiaâs space sector is becoming an attractive destination for global investors. Today, the demand for small satellites is increasing rapidly in the world.â\n\nHe further noted that Indiaâs youth always place national interest above all. Modi said when the government opened the space sector, the countryâs youth, especially the Gen-Z generation, came forward to take full advantage of it.\n\nâToday, over 300 Indian space start-ups are giving new hopes to Indiaâs space future. Most of these space start-ups began with small teams â sometimes two people, sometimes five, sometimes in a small rented room â with limited resources but with determination to reach new heights. I had the opportunity to meet them,â he said, adding this spirit gave birth to the private space revolution in India.\n\nBut what exactly is the Vikram-1? Why is this moment significant for Indiaâs space ambitions?\n\nThe Vikram-I boasts of a capacity to place payloads of around 300 kilogrammes in low earth orbit.\n\nThis space rocket is made out of carbon fibre and can place multiple satellites into orbit and features 3D-printed liquid engines.\n\nThe rocket, according to Skyroot, is as tall as a seven-storey building.\n\nThe company behind Vikram-I, Skyroot, has claimed that the rocket can be assembled and launched within 24 hours from any launch site, offering customers rapid access to space.\n\nSkyroot noted that Vikram-1 is among the âelite fewâ rockets with the capability to deploy orbital satellites.\n\nVikram-I will be launched later this year, said Skyroot. Officials from the company were quoted as tellingIndia Todayearlier, âThe company at the moment is in various stages of testing the different stages of the rocket at multiple facilities spread across India before they will be integrated for launch at Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota.â\n\nIn fact, Skyroot had in November 2022, launched Indiaâs first privately made rocket,Vikram-Son a suborbital flight, carrying three different playloads from Chennai-based start-up SpaceKidz, Andhra Pradesh-based N-SpaceTech and Armenian BazoomQ Space Research Lab.\n\nFor the unaware, Skyroot is a Hyderabad-based space start-up with big dreams. It was established in 2018 by co-founders,Pawan Kumar Chandana and Naga Bharath Daka.\n\nAuthorities dismiss rumours of Imran Khan's death, confirming he is healthy and receiving medical attention. Imran Khan's imprisonment at Adiala Jail has sparked protests and claims of mistreatment, including solitary confinement and restricted communication. Adiala Jail, known for its harsh conditions and overcrowding, holds high-profile inmates and has a notorious history.\n\nGet the latest stories delivered straight to your inbox.",

        "content": "Indiaâs markets climbed to fresh records on Thursday as the Nifty-50 surpassed its September 2024 peak to reach an all-time high of 26,306.95 while the Sensex crossed the 86,000-mark for the first time to touch 86,026.18.\n\nAt 10:15 am, the Sensex was up 318.71 points (0.37 per cent) at 85,928.22 and the Nifty-50 gained 71.10 points (0.28 per cent) to 26,278.40.\n\nA surge in consumption driven by festivals and GST cuts, expectations of a US Federal Reserve rate cut, and hopes of a Ukraine-Russia peace deal are among the factors lifting investor sentiment. Foreign portfolio investors have continued their buying streak in recent days.\n\nThe recent consumption-led rise in spending has made investors optimistic about strong quarterly earnings growth.\n\nâThe consumption boom witnessed in October will translate into impressive earnings growth. If the trend sustains, even with slight moderation after the festival season, earnings growth, going forward, will be good warranting a rally in the market. But there is no room for a sharp sustaining uptrend since valuations do not support that. Expectation of a rate cut by the Fed and a possible Russia-Ukraine peace accord have improved sentiments for equity markets globally,â Dr VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Investments, told Moneycontrol.\n\nAmong Sensex constituents, Bajaj Finance, Bajaj Finserv, ICICI Bank, Larsen & Toubro, Asian Paints and Mahindra & Mahindra were among the biggest gainers.\n\nThe trend is not unique to India. As Ponmudi R, CEO of Enrich Money, noted, global equity markets have extended their gains, buoyed by growing expectations of interest-rate cuts by the Fed.\n\nâMajor US indices âincluding the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaqâ posted another session of solid advances as softer Treasury yields and renewed policy optimism strengthened risk appetite. This upbeat sentiment has carried into todayâs global trade, with Asian markets opening higher,â Ponmudi told PTI.\n\nUnion Cabinet approves â¹7,280-crore scheme to promote domestic manufacturing of Rare Earth Permanent Magnets (REPM).

        "title": "17 years of 26/11: 9 terrorists killed, one hanged; 2 acquitted, justice waits for 6",
        "content": "Seventeen years after 10 Pakistani jihadists began a days-long campaign of terror in Mumbai, India continues its pursuit of justice â one plotter at a time.\n\nEarlier this month, the Bombay High Court ruled that the trial of Abu Jundal, a man accused of training these terrorists and teaching them Hindi, could resume. The trial had been stalled since 2018 because of procedural issues.\n\nPreviously, in April, Tahawwur Rana was extradited to India after years of efforts. His trial for facilitating the 26/11 attacks is ongoing.\n\nIn the past 17 years, an entire generation has come of age, but India has not moved on. Instead, it has continued to seek and prosecute those behind the attack, though several remain beyond India’s reach â Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) co-founders Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi and Hafiz Saeed, senior LeT operative Sajid Mir, the Inter-Services Intelligenceâs (ISI) shadowy ‘Major Iqbal’, who are all at large in Pakistan, and David Coleman Headley, who is jailed in the United States.\n\nThe pursuit of justice has not been without flaws. Two men tried for being part of the 26/11 plot, Fahim Ansari and Sabauddin Ahmed, were acquitted. They were, however, convicted in the case of a terrorist attack on a CRPF camp in 2007. But they were acquitted in that case as well by a higher court this year.\n\nNoting the defective investigation in the CRPF attack case, the Allahabad High Court said the âcase would have met a different result had the investigation and prosecution been conducted by more trained policeâ.\n\nThe fact that Ansari and Ahmed were charged in two cases by different courts âand subsequently acquitted by different courtsâ has made their cases among the most controversial in Indiaâs counter-terrorism history.\n\nPakistanâs conspiracy began to unravel when Ajmal Amir Kasab was captured alive.\n\nAccording to former Mumbai Police Commissioner Rakesh Maria, who ran the control room when the attack began, the terrorists were meant to present themselves as Hindus â hiding their links to Pakistan.\n\nIn his book ‘Let Me Say It Now’, Maria wrote, âIf all had gone well, he [Kasab] would have been dead with a red string tied around his wrist like a Hindu. We would have found an identity card on his person with a fictitious name: Samir Dinesh Chaudhari, student of Arunodaya degree and PG collegeâ¦ Bengaluruâ¦ There would have been screaming headlines on newspapers claiming how Hindu terrorists had attacked Mumbai. Over the top TV journalists would have made a beeline for Bengaluru to interview his family and neighbours. But alas, it had not worked that way and here he was, Ajmal Amir Kasab of Faridkot in Pakistan.â\n\nKasab was tried, convicted, and hanged till death in 2012.\n\nIndia then landed in its net Abu Jundal, whose real name is Zabiuddin Ansari. He is believed to have trained Kasab and the other terrorists.\n\nAbu Jundal was extradited to India in 2012 from Saudi Arabia, where he had moved after spending years in Pakistan. But his case stalled in 2018 over allegations of improper procedures involved in the extradition. The Bombay High Court ruled earlier this month that his trial could resume.\n\nAbu Jundal is understood to have been present in the LeTâs control room in Karachi, Pakistan, which oversaw the 26/11 attacks. This makes him the only person in Indian custody who was at the nerve centre of the entire operation.\n\nBeyond the 26/11 attacks, Ansari has been serving a life term in the 2006 Aurangabad arms haul case.\n\nPreviously, in April, India landed in its net Tahawwur Rana, a Pakistani-Canadian jihadist who facilitated the attacks. The extradition came after years of efforts.\n\nRana deserted the Pakistan Army, where he was a captain, and moved to Canada where he became a citizen. He then moved to the United States and settled in Chicago where he opened several businesses. One of these businesses, an immigration consultancy, was part of the LeTâs plot to strike Mumbai.\n\nRana is tied to another accused in the case, David Coleman Headley, who used the consultancy as cover to travel to India and plan the Mumbai attacks.\n\nHeadley has testified that he scouted locations in Mumbai and that Rana helped him obtain a visa and allowed him to open a Mumbai-based office using the name of Ranaâs company âFirst World Immigration Services Incâ while knowing his true purpose of planning a terrorist attack. As per the testimony, Rana facilitated the 26/11 attacks by arranging the scouting and helping Headley, a member of the plot.\n\nRana was also in touch with another accused in the case, Major Iqbal, who remains at large in Pakistan.\n\nLeT co-founders Lakhvi and Saeed along with ISIâs Major Iqbal and senior LeT operative Sajid Mir remain at large in Pakistan.\n\nMajor Iqbalâs real name is Chaudhry Khan, according to Headley.\n\nAt points, Mir has been described as one of the main planners of the attack. Both he and Iqbal are believed to be regular officers of the Pakistan Army who either joined the ISI or the LeT. In any case, they are believed to have worked for and with both the organisations. Considering the close cooperation between the ISI and Pakistan-based jihadist groups, the lines between the two sides are, in any case, blurry.\n\nLakhvi and Saeed have been leading a jihadist campaign for decades. After their latest attack on India in Jammu and Kashmirâs Pahalgam in April, India struck LeTâs headquarters, among several jihadist sites in Pakistan, under Operation Sindoor.\n\nWhile Lakhvi and Saeed survived, Jaish-e-Mohammedâs Masood Azhar lost several family members in another strike on Jaishâs headquarters as part of the operation. Azharâs Jaish was behind the Pulwama bombing that killed 49 CRPF personnel in 2019.\n\nHeadley has admitted he was part of the 26/11 plot. He has admitted receiving training and operational directions from Iqbal and Mir, and that the ISI was centrally involved in planning and executing the attack.\n\nHeadley also admitted that he visited Mumbai for reconnaissance and scouted the Taj and Oberoi hotels, Leopold Cafe, Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, and Nariman House at the instructions of his Pakistani handlers. Kasab and his fellow terrorists attacked all of these locations.\n\nHowever, as part of his plea agreement with the US government, Headley cannot be extradited to India.\n\nBut Headleyâs case has revealed a damning missed opportunity. It emerged that US agencies had information suggesting he was plotting a terrorist attack in India. Whether these inputs were shared with India on time could be up for questions. But these inputs were indeed shared, whether early or late, and what’s a proven fact is that Indian agencies could not prevent the attacks despite repeated warnings.\n\nA ProPublica investigation reported that Headleyâs wife had warned US agencies three times in 2007 and 2008 that he was plotting a terrorist attack in Mumbai.\n\nSeparately, in their book ‘The Siege: The Attack On The Taj’, Adrian Levy and Cathy Scott-Clark wrote that the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had shared 26 intelligence alerts with India and some of these inputs were very specific, such as the CIA informing India about the use of âfidayeen, meaning guerrillas armed with grenades and AK-47s who fought to the death, inflicting heavy casualties before being overcomeâ.\n\nâEleven warnings suggested the plan would involve multiple simultaneous attacks. Six warnings pointed to a sea-borne infiltration, which would be a first in India,â wrote Levy and Scott-Clark.\n\nAnd this exactly how the attack was carried out. Indian agencies were informed and the attack could not be prevented.\n\nReferring to these inputs, ProPublicaâs investigative journalist Sebastian Rotella noted that âUS agencies learned enough about him [Headley] to glean fragments of intelligenceâ that went into these warnings.\n\nâUS and foreign officials say his role as an informant or ex-informant helped him elude detection as he was training in Pakistani terror camps and travelling back and forth to Mumbai to scout targets. And three counterterror sources say US agencies learned enough about him to glean fragments of intelligence that contributed to the warnings to India about a developing plot against Mumbai,â noted Rotella.\n\nI am a chief sub-editor at Firstpost.

The scheme to promote manufacturing of sintered rare earth permanent magnetsâ was cleared at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nREPMare one of the strongest types of permanent magnets and are vital for electric vehicles, renewable energy, electronics, aerospace, and defence applications. The Scheme will support the creation of integrated REPM manufacturing facilities, involving conversion of rare earth oxides to metals, metals to alloys, and alloys to finished REPMs.\n\nâThe scheme aims to create capacity of 6,000 MTPA (metric tonne per annum),â Information and Broadcasting Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw told reporters.\n\n#CabinetApproves Rs.7,280 Crore Scheme to Promote Manufacturing of Sintered Rare Earth Permanent Magnets (REPM)â¡ï¸First-of-its-kind initiative by the Government of India to promote REPM ecosystem, enhancing self-reliance and positioning India as a key player in the global REPMâ¦pic.twitter.com/3fb9St8gCb\n\nRare earth magnets are used in major industries including electric vehicles, aerospace, electronics, medical devices and defence.\n\nDriven by the rapidly growing demand from electric vehicles, renewable energy, industrial applications, and consumer electronics, India’s consumption of REPMs is expected to double by 2030 from 2025.\n\nAt present, India’s demand for REPMs is met primarily through imports. With this initiative, India will establish its first ever integrated REPM manufacturing facilities, generating employment, strengthening self-reliance and advancing the nation’s commitment to achieve Net Zero by 2070.\n\n“The total financial outlay of the scheme is Rs.7280 crore, comprising a sales-linked incentives of Rs. 6450 crore on REPM sales for five (5) years and capital subsidy of Rs.750 crore for setting up an aggregate of 6,000 MTPA of REPM manufacturing facilities,” the government said in a statement.ÂÂ\n\nThe scheme envisions allocating the total capacity to five beneficiaries through a global competitive bidding process. Each beneficiary will be allotted up to 1,200 MTPA of capacity.\n\nThe total duration of the scheme will be 7 years from the date of award, including a 2-year gestation period for setting up an integrated REPM manufacturing facility, and 5 years for incentive disbursement on the sale of REPM.\n\nIndia's Chief Economic Advisor V. Anantha Nageswaran announced the economy will exceed $4 trillion this fiscal year, up from $3.9 trillion.

        "title": "How Indian-American US diplomat has exposed fraud in H-1B visa programme",
        "content": "The US’ H-1B visa programme is once again under scrutiny, and this time, the storm has been kicked up by an Indian-American diplomat herself.\n\nMahvash Siddiqui, who previously served at the US consulate in Chennai, has alleged that large-scale and organised fraud is happening in the system. According to her, a big chunk ofH-1B visasissued to Indians were secured through dishonest means.\n\nHer claims have been amplified by formerUSRepresentative and economist Dr Dave Brat, who says the numbers coming out of certain consulates donât add up, alleging an “industrial-scale fraud” with the visa allocations.\n\nThe H-1B is one of Americaâs most sought-after work visas, heavily used by US companies to bring in specialised foreign workers, and Indians have long been the biggest recipients.\n\nSo, what exactly are they alleging? And does it point to deeper cracks in the programme? Here’s a closer look\n\nSiddiqui, who served at the US consulate in Chennai between 2005 and 2007, shared her concerns on a podcast, where she spoke openly about what she witnessed as a consular officer.\n\nChennai, or Madras, is one of the busiest H-1B processing hubs in the world, and she pointed out that officials there handled huge volumes, including 220,000 H-1B visas and 140,000 H-4 visas for dependents in 2024 alone.\n\nSiddiqui said she was speaking in her personal capacity, not as a diplomat.Â  She questioned the popular belief that the US faces a shortage of Stem (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) talent and therefore must rely heavily on Indian workers.\n\nAccording to her, the real issue lies elsewhere. Siddiqui alleged that 80â90 per cent of visas issued to Indians, especially H-1Bs, were fraudulent. She claimed many applications were supported by fake degrees, forged documents, or involved applicants who did not actually meet the skill level required for these specialised jobs.\n\nShe said that during her time in Chennai, the team began spotting these patterns early on and alerted senior officials. But the response, she claims, was deeply disappointing.\n\n“We quickly learnt about the fraud. We wrote a dissent cable to the Secretary of State, detailing the systematic fraud we were uncovering. But due to political pressure from the top, our adjudication was overturned,” she said during the podcast.\n\nSiddiqui alleged that no corrective action was taken because of âpolitical pressureâ, allowing the cycle to continue.\n\nEconomist and former Congressman Dr Dave Brat has also raised questions about the numbers themselves. He pointed out that the national cap for H-1B visas is 85,000, yet Chennai alone allegedly accounted for 220,000 approvals.\n\nDR. DAVE BRAT: 71% of H-1B visas come from India. The national cap is 85,000, yet one Indian district got 220,000! That's 2.5x the limit!When you hear H-1B, think of your family, because these fraudulent visas just stole their future.@brateconomicspic.twitter.com/8O1v8qVJPe\n\n“That tells you something’s going on right there. Then there’s a cap of only 85,000 H-1B visas, but somehow one district in India, the Madras (Chennai) district, got 220,000, two and a half times the cap Congress has set,” the former Republican lawmaker said.\n\nAlso read:A new US bill to replace H-1B lottery system? What it means for Indian workers and Big Tech\n\nSiddiqui said she spent two years at the Chennai consulate, during which she personally adjudicated more than 51,000 non-immigrant visas, most of them under the H-1B category.\n\nShe explained that the Chennai post handled visa applications from four major regions: Hyderabad, Karnataka, Kerala, and Tamil Nadu. Among them, she said, Hyderabad stood out as the most troubling in terms of irregularities.\n\n“As an Indian-American, I hate to say this, but fraud and bribery are normalised in India,” she said during the podcast.\n\nAccording to her, the issues went far beyond paperwork. Siddiqui alleged that some candidates avoided interviews altogether if the interviewing officer was American, while in other cases, proxy applicants appeared on behalf of the real candidate.\n\nShe also claimed that certain Indian managers were offering jobs to fellow Indians in exchange for a portion of their salary, further fuelling a system that, in her view, had become deeply compromised.\n\nElon Musk's X launched a new feature revealing account locations, causing uproar in India and the US.

        "title": "India poised to cross $4 trillion GDP in current fiscal, CEA says",
        "content": "Indiaâs Chief Economic Advisor V. Anantha Nageswaran said on Tuesday that Indiaâs economy is on track to surpass $4 trillion in the current financial year, adding that strong and sustained growth is essential for preserving the countryâs global influence amid shifting geopolitical dynamics.\n\nIndia is presently the worldâs fifth-largest economy with a GDP of around $3.9 trillion. Speaking at the IVCA Green Returns Summit 2025, Nageswaran said the economy is already on the verge of crossing the $4 trillion mark during this fiscal year, rising from $3.9 trillion at the end of March 2025.\n\nNageswaran said that efforts linked to greening the economy, energy transition, environmental management, and responses to climate volatility must remain aligned with national priorities in both the near and medium term. He added that India recognises the potential consequences of global warming and climate change for agriculture, the environment, and coastlines.\n\nHe reaffirmed that this awareness underpins Indiaâs commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2070.\n\nIndiaâs economy likely expanded by 7.3% in the JulyâSeptember quarter, a Reuters poll of economists showed, supported by robust rural demand and sustained government expenditure, even as private capital investment remained weak.Household consumptionâabout 60% of Indiaâs total economic activityâpicked up last quarter as improved agricultural output boosted rural spending. However, urban demand and private investment continued to trail, highlighting uneven momentum in Asiaâs third-largest economy.Government expenditure, which has been a major growth engine in recent years, is also expected to have remained strong in the second quarter of the fiscal year.\n\nThe NIA arrested Soyab from Faridabad for aiding Umar Un Nabi, the suicide bomber in the Red Fort blast that killed 15 and injured 20. Soyab provided logistical support and harbored Umar before the attack. This incident is linked to a terrorist module spanning J&K, Haryana, and UP.\n\nGet the latest stories delivered straight to your inbox.",

        "title": "Inside Dubai's Naia Island, where billionaire Lakshmi Mittal is reportedly moving",
        "content": "Steel billionaire Lakshmi Mittal, one of the UKâs most prominent industrialists for decades, is now reportedly preparing to base himself in Dubaiâs Naia Island.\n\nMittal already has a home in Dubai, butThe Sunday Timesreport says he has recently purchased âtracts of an intriguing development on nearby NaÃ¯a Island,â an exclusive, high-security enclave designed for the global elite.\n\nAccording to the report, Mittal began stepping away from full-time residency in theUKas the Labour Party-led government is likely to introduce a series of wealth and inheritance tax changes. These new rules have pushed several ultra-rich individuals to reassess where they call home.\n\nNaia Island is a soon-to-rise, private man-made island taking shape just off Dubaiâs Jumeirah coastline, and itâs already attracting the worldâs wealthiest, includingLakshmi Mittal.\n\nThe project is being developed by Shamal Holding, right in the waters off Jumeirahâs beachfront. Once complete, Naia Island will be a super-luxury enclave featuring the regionâs first Cheval Blanc maison, a high-end hospitality brand under the LVMH group.\n\nPositioned between Umm Suqeim and Jumeirah 3, the low-rise island will offer a mix of private villas and suites designed for maximum privacy and beachfront living.\n\nShamal Holding, the Dubai-based diversified investment firm, today unveiled NaÃ¯a Island Dubai, a landmark private estate set to redefine ultra-luxury living in the region.pic.twitter.com/ScXw240tvl\n\nThe villas on Naia Island reportedly begin at AED 45 million (around Rs 109.3 crore). Buyers are required to file an Expression of Interest, follow a structured payment schedule, and pay a 4 per cent Dubai Land Department fee. The investment also unlocks a10-year UAE Golden Visa.\n\nConstruction on the island has already begun, though developers have yet to announce an exact completion date. The project is expected to open in 2029 and is positioned as a key piece of Dubaiâs â2030 Visionâ for premium tourism and ultra-luxury living.\n\nLakshmi Mittalâs gradual shift away from the UK is largely tied to changing tax rules.\n\nAccording toThe Sunday Times,several of the UKâs upcoming policies have unsettled wealthy residents. These include a proposed 20 per cent exit tax, the possible introduction of a mansion tax, the scrapping of the non-domicile regime, and inheritance taxes that currently stand at 40 per cent.\n\nFor years, ânon-domsâ were allowed to pay tax only on the income earned within Britain, ensuring that their foreign earnings remained outside the UK tax net. With that system being dismantled, many high-net-worth individuals are reassessing their future in the country.\n\nA friend close to Mittal toldThe Financial Times,“He is exploring his options and will take a final decision over the course of this year. There is a good chance he will cease to be a UK tax resident.”\n\nBy shifting his main base to the UAE, Mittal gains access to a system built on predictability, investment-friendly policies, and, most significantly, zero inheritance tax. The emirateâs tax-free model gives billionaires like Mittal the long-term stability needed to manage global assets, avoid sudden fiscal changes, and invest freely in high-value real estate.\n\nThis financial certainty is one of the key reasons Dubai has become a magnet for global wealth, drawing in business leaders seeking both security and a luxurious lifestyle. It also explains why many are now investing in premium developments like NaÃ¯a Island, where Mittal has reportedly purchased large plots.\n\nAlso read:ÂWhy global millionaires are flocking to purchase UAEâs golden visa\n\nLakshmi Mittal, born in Rajasthan, is widely known as the âKing of Steelâ,Â  a title earned through decades of transforming the global steel industry.\n\nAfter completing his commerce degree from a college affiliated to the University of Calcutta, he joined his fatherâs small steel business. In his early 20s, Mittal branched out independently, setting up his own mill in Indonesia.\n\nBack in the 1970s and 80s, the steel industry was scattered across the world, dominated by inefficient and often loss-making state-run mills. Mittal spotted an opportunity. He began acquiring these struggling plants, reviving them, and integrating them into a single, streamlined global operation.\n\nHis boldest move came in 2006, when he took over the Luxembourg-based steel giant Arcelor. The merger formed ArcelorMittal, now the worldâs second-largest steel producer.\n\nToday, ArcelorMittal is valued at more than Â£25 billion in the stock market. The Mittal family owns close to 40 per cent of the company, which employs over 125,000 people across more than 60 countries, including the UK. The group was ranked eighth in this yearâs Sunday Times Rich List.\n\nBeyond ArcelorMittal, Lakshmi Mittal holds a similar stake in Aperam, the stainless-steel manufacturer, and nearly half of HPCL-Mittal Energy.\n\nHe moved to the UK in 1995, settling there with his wife, Usha, and their two children. Over the years, he purchased some of Britainâs most expensive properties, including three homes on Londonâs ultra-exclusive Kensington Palace Gardens, often dubbed âBillionairesâ Rowâ.\n\nElon Musk's X launched a new feature revealing account locations, causing uproar in India and the US.

        "title": "'Arunachal Pradesh inalienable part of India': MEA rejects China’s claim after detention of citizen at Shanghai airport",
        "content": "Hours after China repeated its claim thatArunachal Pradesh was a part of Chinaamid a row over the harassment of an Arunachal-born woman by immigration officials during a transit halt at Shanghai airport, India on Tuesday sharply rejected Beijing’s claims, saying, “Arunachal Pradesh is an integral and inalienable part of India, and this is a self-evident fact.”\n\nThe comments came after a controversial statement from the Chinese Foreign Ministry once again challenged India’s sovereignty over Arunachal Pradesh.\n\n“We have seen statements made by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the arbitrary detention of an Indian citizen from Arunachal Pradesh, who was holding a valid passport and was transiting through Shanghai International Airport on her onward travel to Japan,” said MEA Spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.\n\n“Arunachal Pradesh is an integral and inalienable part of India, and this is a self-evident fact. No amount of denial by the Chinese side is going to change this indisputable reality,” he added.\n\nJaiswal said the issue of the detention has been taken up strongly with the Chinese side.\n\n“Chinese authorities have still not been able to explain their actions, which are in violation of several conventions governing international air travel. The actions by the Chinese authorities also violate their own regulations that allow visa free transit up to 24 hours for nationals of all countries,” he said.\n\nThe passenger, Prema Wang Thongdok, who hails from Rupa in West Kameng district and currently resides in the UK, was travelling from London to Japan on November 21 with a scheduled three-hour layover in Shanghai. What should have been a routine transit turned into a harrowing ordeal.\n\nThongdok later took to X to describe the experience: “I was held at Shanghai airport for over 18 hrs on 21st Nov, 2025… They called my Indian passport invalid as my birthplace is Arunachal Pradesh which they claimed is Chinese territory.”\n\nDespite carrying all valid travel documents, she was reportedly denied free passage, given conflicting instructions, and only released after prolonged questioning, during which she said her documents were repeatedly challenged and invalidated on political grounds.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning denied any wrongdoing, asserting that the passenger “was not subjected to any compulsory measures, detainment or harassment.”\n\nMao added that airport officials acted “according to laws and regulations,” and claimed the airline had provided the passenger “food, water, and a place to rest.”\n\nHowever, Maoâs comments escalated tensions by reiterating Beijingâs territorial claim:\n\n“Zangnan is China’s territory. China never acknowledged the so-called Arunachal Pradesh illegally set up by India,” she said.\n\nThe statement drew immediate criticism from India, which accused Beijing of distorting established facts and politicising a routine travel procedure.\n\nAccording toNDTV, citing government, India issued a strong demarche in both capitals on the day of the incident. The Indian Consulate in Shanghai also intervened to assist the stranded passenger.\n\nOfficials described the detention as based on “ludicrous grounds” and said it undermined efforts by both nations to stabilise bilateral ties.\n\n“At a time when both sides are working on restoring normalcy, such actions by the Chinese side introduce unnecessary obstructions to the process,”NDTVquoted sources as saying.\n\nChinese state media urged President Xi Jinping to drop nuclear bombs on Japan in response to PM Sanae Takaichi's stance on Taiwan. A Chinese diplomat threatened Takaichi, while a CPC-controlled website detailed a plan involving 72 nuclear bombs to deindustrialize and demilitarize Japan. The report outlined three attack phases targeting military, industrial, and infrastructure sites.\n\nGet the latest stories delivered straight to your inbox.",

        "content": "Ash clouds from the massive eruption of the Hayli Gubbi Volcano in Ethiopia have now drifted as far asDelhi, with environmental experts confirming visible traces of volcanic fallout over several parts of India.\n\nThe unusual atmospheric event comes after the volcanoâdormant for thousands of yearsâerupted with explosive force, sending a towering plume of ash and gases high into the upper atmosphere.\n\nâï¸ððªð¹ - Ethiopia's Hayli Gubbi Volcano Awakens After 10,000 YearsIn a stunning geological event, Ethiopia's Hayli Gubbi volcanoâlong dormant in the remote Danakil Depression of the Afar Riftâerupted explosively for the first time in recorded history on November 23, 2025.Theâ¦pic.twitter.com/bZby4sAuOC\n\nAccording to environmentalist Vimlendu Jha, the drifting ash has already been sighted across western and northern states. âThe eruption of Ethopiaâs volcano is enormous, and if you see it in the last 24 hours, whether we talk about Gujarat, Rajasthan or even in the last 12 hours, we can even see the ashes floating around Delhi,â he toldANI, noting that satellite imagery and ground observations both confirm the plumeâs long-distance movement.\n\nThe arrival of ash clouds over India has triggered public concern, particularly in the capital, where persistent winter smog and rising pollution levels have already strained air quality.\n\nBut Jha stressed that residents in Delhi are unlikely to face an immediate deterioration of air conditions due to the volcanic debris. âThe overall impact of the eruption will be in the form of ash clouds and will not immediately affect the AQI in Delhi. The clouds are made of sulphur dioxide (SO2) and glass particles. Though it will not immediately affect the AQI, we need to monitor it, as the clouds are in the very upper atmosphere,â he explained.\n\nAtmospheric scientists say the volcanic plume has risen to altitudes where winds can transport particles across continents without allowing them to mix quickly with air near the surface.\n\nSuch high-level ash often travels thousands of kilometres before gradually descending, a process that can take days or even weeks depending on weather conditions.\n\nJha cautioned, however, that other regions could see effects sooner than Delhi. âThe impact of these clouds might be seen in the Himalayas, the Tarai region (a lowland region of flat, alluvial soil that forms a belt along the Nepal-India border) and even parts of China,â he said, adding that elevated terrains and valleys often register early signs of atmospheric dust and ash deposition.\n\nAuthorities in India are now closely tracking the plumeâs trajectory, coordinating with global atmospheric monitoring networks to assess whether the ash could influence regional weather patterns or contribute to long-term pollutant loads.\n\nCanada close to finalising US$2.8 billion uranium deal with India.

        "content": "Canada is reportedly close to finalising a landmark US$2.8 billion deal to supply uranium to India over the next decade, strengthening nuclear energy cooperation between the two countries.\n\nA source familiar with the negotiations toldHindustan Times, âThe agreement is at an advanced stage and we expect it to be finalised soon. Cameco Corp., Canadaâs key uranium producer, will supply the fuel to Indiaâs nuclear plants.â\n\nThe discussions follow a recent bilateral meeting between Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the G20 summit in Johannesburg. After the meeting, an official statement said, âBoth leaders reaffirmed their commitment to deepening civil nuclear cooperation, including long-term uranium supply agreements.â\n\nIndian officials have previously indicated interest in small modular reactors, suggesting the deal could be part of a broader, strategic nuclear partnership. One official commented, âThis agreement is not just about uranium; it signals a strengthening of energy and technological collaboration between India and Canada.â\n\nIf sealed, the deal would expand the framework established under the CanadaâIndia Nuclear Cooperation Agreement of 2013, which would be a significant step in bilateral trade and energy relations.\n\nIn June 2023, Hardeepâ¯Singh Nijjar, a Canadian Sikh activist and a prominent figure in the Khalistan separatist movement (he led the banned Khalistan Tiger Force), was shot dead outside a gurdwara in Surrey, British Columbia.\n\nCanadaâs then Prime Minister Justin Trudeau later claimed there was âcredible intelligenceâ suggesting that agents of the Indian government were involved in orchestrating the killing. This sparked a major diplomatic crisis between Ottawa and New Delhi.\n\nIndia strongly denied any involvement. New Delhi called the allegations âabsurdâ and âmotivated,â saying they were part of a smear campaign and accusing Canada of harbouring extremist elements.\n\nHowever, a Canadian commission report released later concluded there was no definitive link between a foreign state (i.e., India) and Nijjarâs killing.\n\nIndia's economy likely grew 7.3% in July-September, boosted by rural and government spending, despite weak private investment.

        "title": "Indian economy likely grew at 7.3% in Sept quarter, say economists; official figures on Friday",
        "content": "India’s economy likely grew 7.3% in the JulyâSeptember quarter, according to a Reuters poll of economists, underpinned by strong rural and government expenditure even as private capital spending remained subdued.\n\nHousehold consumption, which accounts for roughly 60% of the economy, strengthened in the previous quarter as rural spending improved on better agricultural output. Urban demand and private investment continued to lag, suggesting uneven growth in Asia’s third-largest economy.\n\nGovernment spending, a key driver of growth in recent years, also likely persisted in Q2 of this fiscal year.\n\nIndia remains one of the world’s fastest-growing major economies in the face of U.S. President Donald Trump raising tariffs on Indian goods to 50% in August, a move that has contributed to foreign investors pulling out a net $16 billion from Indian equities so far this year.\n\nMost economists say the deflator, used to strip out the effect of inflation to show “real” economic growth, was likely very low, making Asia’s third-largest economy seem a bit stronger than it really is.\n\nIndian gross domestic product (GDP) expanded 7.3% year-on-year in the JulyâSeptember period, down from a better-than-expected 7.8% in the previous quarter, according to the median forecast from a Reuters poll of 61 economists conducted November 18â24. Estimates ranged from 6.0% to 8.5%.\n\n“As far as the drivers of growth are concerned, private consumption and central government capex expenditure will remain the key supports for growth now, while private sector capex investment will likely grow at a slower pace due to the persisting global uncertainty,” Kaushik Das, India chief economist at Deutsche Bank, said.\n\nEconomists are more cautious on the medium-term outlook, predicting GDP growth to slow to 6.8% this quarter and 6.3% in the quarter ending in March 2026.\n\nA low deflator - which falls when inflation cools - also provided a boost to the latest data, as it did in the previous quarter, several economists said.\n\n“GDP will benefit from a lower base and an exceptionally low deflator, which will artificially prop up real GDP growth … But nominal GDP growth will likely continue to be weak,” Deutsche Bank’s Das said.\n\nWholesale price inflation was negligible and consumer inflation was on average around 2% between JulyâSeptember.\n\nInflation has since fallen to less than half a percent.\n\n“Inflation projections now for the rest of the year also remain soft,” Rajni Thakur, chief economist at L&T Finance, said. “We really don’t see this deflator support - which is statistically impacting real GDP numbers - going away till the end of this fiscal year.”\n\nEconomic activity as measured by gross value added (GVA) was estimated to have expanded 7.15%. Nominal GDP growth, which is not adjusted for price changes, likely slowed to 8.3% last quarter from 8.8% previously, the poll predicted. Those are based on a smaller sample of forecasters.\n\nMeanwhile, recent cuts to the consumption tax, part of a major overhaul of the national goods and services tax (GST) system and implemented from September 22, are expected to give some support to demand in the coming quarters.\n\n“Unfortunately, GST cuts have come at a time when Indian households are already heavily indebted. That takes away part of the disposable income they could otherwise have saved from the tax reductions,” said Dhiraj Nim, economist at ANZ.\n\n(Except the headline, this story has not been edited by Firstpost staff.)\n\nHayli Gubbi volcano in Ethiopia erupted after 12,000 years, sending ash across the Red Sea. Volcanic ash reached India, impacting air travel and causing advisories from DGCA. Delhi's air quality remains poor, but volcanic ash is unlikely to significantly worsen pollution levels.\n\nGet the latest stories delivered straight to your inbox.",

        "content": "Ayodhya is gearing up for a momentous day on Tuesday, as Prime MinisterNarendra Modileads the ‘Dhwajarohanâ, a traditional ritual where a sacred flag is hoisted on the main spire of the Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Temple.\n\nThe Ram temple,which was consecrated in January 2024, has continued to take shape over the past year through different phases of construction. This ceremony marks the official completion of the temple complex.\n\nModi is expected to attend the event alongside Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat. This will also be the Prime Ministerâs second trip to the temple since its inauguration last year.\n\nCrowds have already started pouring intoAyodhyaahead of the ceremony. Devotees from various parts of the country have reached the holy town, which has been adorned for the occasion, including floral decorations, with nearly 100 kg of flowers used around the temple,ANIreports.\n\nVIDEO | Ayodhya is filled with devotion as preparations for the Ram Mandir flag-hoisting ceremony reach their final stage.

Nearly 6,000 invited guests are expected toâ¦pic.twitter.com/sZWz2eXS1q\n\nHereâs a quick look at why the Dhwajarohan matters, and how Ayodhya is getting ready for the ceremony.\n\nThe sacred flag that will be raised atop the Ram Temple will be 22 feet long and 11 feet wide, and it will sit on a 42-foot pole fixed to the templeâs 161-foot main spire, symbolising the completion of the templeâs construction.\n\nFitted with a 360-degree rotating mechanism supported by ball bearings, it can withstand wind speeds of up to 60 km per hour without bending or getting damaged.\n\nðð@narendramodið­ð¨ ð¡ð¨ð¢ð¬ð­ ð¬ðððð«ð¨ð§ ðð¥ðð  ðð­ð¨ð© ðð¡ð«ð¢ ððð¦ ððð§ð¦ððð¡ð¨ð¨ð¦ð¢ ððð§ðð¢ð« ð¢ð§ ðð²ð¨ðð¡ð²ð, symbolising completion of templeâs construction.Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Mandir is beautifully decorated ahead of todayâs historicâ¦pic.twitter.com/VhNTMQgs6H\n\nAccording to a report inThe Print,which cites RSS mouthpieceOrganiser,the flag was produced in Ahmedabad by a company that usually manufactures parachutes.\n\nTo make sure it lasts through harsh weather, it has been woven using a combination of silk threads and parachute-grade fabric. Its durability standards were finalised after consultations with senior Army officers.\n\nThe flag carries three symbolic motifs: Om, the Sun, and the Kovidara tree. As per tradition, the Kovidara tree is believed to be a hybrid of the Mandar and Parijat trees, created by Rishi Kashyap. This reference is often linked to early Indian practices of plant hybridisation.\n\nThe Sun emblem represents Lord Ramâs connection to the Suryavanshi dynasty, while Om stands for the primordial cosmic sound.\n\nIndologist Lalit Mishra is credited with uncovering the historical design of this flag. He traced its origins while studying a Mewar-style pictorial Ramayana manuscript, and later found supporting references in the Ayodhya Kand of the Valmiki Ramayana.\n\nAlso read:World's firstRamayanwax museum to open inAyodhya. Hereâs all you need to know\n\nThe Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Teerth Kshetra Trust has invited around 6,000 to 7,000 people from across Uttar Pradesh for the ceremony. The guest list is a mix of communities, people from different caste groups, families from rural areas, and prominent industrialists who supported the temple project.\n\nAccording to Trust officials, the âshubh muhuratâ for the ritual falls between 11:52 am and 12:35 pm, and the main ceremony will last only about four minutes. Nearly 21 Vedic acharyas will perform the rituals, while volunteers will blow conch shells as part of the traditional welcome,The Printreports.\n\nTo make the moment more special, helicopters will shower flower petals over the temple spire as the flag is hoisted.\n\nThe date itself holds symbolic meaning. As per tradition, Lord Rama and Sita were married on Panchami, the fifth day of Shukla Paksha in the month of Margashirsha during the Treta Yuga. This year, November 25, falls on the same Panchami, making it an especially auspicious day for the Dhwajarohan ceremony.\n\n#WATCH| Ayodhya | On the flag-hoisting ceremony of Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Temple, MLA Abhay Singh says, \"Preparations are underway.

        "title": "Flights delayed, air pollution rising… How Ethiopian volcano ash is disrupting life in India",
        "content": "Ash-tonishing! After 12,000 years, a volcano has erupted in Ethiopiaâs north-eastern region, sending thick plumes of smoke across the Red Sea towards Yemen, Oman, India and parts of northern Pakistan.\n\nAnd with thick plumes of volcanic ash coming our way, authorities in India are bracing potential disruption to air travel as well as air pollution levels spiking across parts of north India, which are already choking on toxic air.\n\nSo, how bad is the situation expected to be after the Hayli Gubbi volcano eruption? How will the volcano eruption in Ethiopia be felt in India?\n\nOn Sunday morning (November 23), a long-dormant volcano, theHayli Gubbi, in northern Ethiopia eruptedsending plumes of ash into the skies. Describing the moment the eruption took place, Ahmed Abdela, a resident of the Afar region, said it âfelt like a sudden bomb had been thrownâ. Many people who had been heading to the Danakil desert, a local tourist attraction, were left stranded in ash-covered Afdera on Monday, he said.\n\nFortunately, no casualties were recorded following the eruption. However, local official, Mohammed Seid said that the eruption could have economic implications for the local community of livestock herders. âWhile no human lives and livestock have been lost so far, many villages have been covered in ash and as a result their animals have little to eat,â he said.\n\nNotably, this is the first time in 12,000 years that Hayli Gubbi has erupted with images showing towering plumes of ash emerging from the volcanoâs summit. Experts say that Hayli Gubbi is a shield volcano, like Hawaiiâs Mauna Loa. These volcanoes are known for oozing lava flows, not expelling giant columns of ash.\n\nAs Juliet Biggs, an earth scientist at the University of Bristol in England, toldScientific American: âTo see a big eruption column, like a big umbrella cloud, is really rare in this area.â\n\nFollowing the eruption in Ethiopia,plumes of thick smoke beganto move across the Red Sea and by Monday night, around 11 pm, reached Delhi, the capital of India. Forecasters had been tracking the cloud for a day, as it made its way to the Capital â travelling at 130 kmph.\n\nWeather trackers said the plume first entered India over western Rajasthan. âThe ash cloud has now entered the Indian subcontinent from the JodhpurâJaisalmer region and is moving northeast at 120â130 kmph,â the India Met Sky Weather alert said. âSkies may look weird and funny for a while, but there is less to worry about as the ash lies between 25,000 and 45,000 feet.â\n\nBy late Monday evening, the plume had stretched over parts of Rajasthan, Haryana and Delhi. Forecasters have noted that the volcanic ash will enter Gujarat this evening by 10 pm and then move to northwest Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana, and Punjab, and later it will impact the Himalayas and other regions.\n\nâThis is between 15-25,000 up to 45,000 feet up in the sky and contains mostly volcanic ash, sulphur dioxide and some small particles of glass/rock which will make the sky appear darker and impact air traffic and air route which will bring delays and longer travel. The ash cloud is about to enter Gujarat (west side) and move towards Rajasthan NW, Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana and Punjab by 10 pm and later it will impact the Himalayas and other regions. It will make the sky appear darker and hazier than usual and people may send us pics of the sky if possible,â wrote IndiaMetSky Weather on X.\n\nWith the volcanic ash drifting over north India, Indiaâs aviation regulator, the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), issued an advisory to airlines and airports to deal with possible disruptions caused by it. The DGCA in its advisory instructed airlines to strictly avoid published volcanic ash affected areas and flight levels, adjust flight planning, routing and fuel considerations based on the latest advisories.\n\nIt further stated that airlines have been instructed to immediately report any suspected ash encounter, including engine performance anomalies or cabin smoke/odour. The DGCA have asked the operators to ensure continuous monitoring of the situation related to the volcanic ash cloud and stay updated through satellite imagery and meteorological data, among other things.\n\nIn fact, the volcanic eruption has already led to significant air travel disruption. Akasa Air, IndiGo and KLM are among the airlines that have cancelled flights due to the volcanic ash issue.\n\nAkasa Air said its flights to and from Jeddah, Kuwait, and Abu Dhabi scheduled for November 24 and 25 have been cancelled due to the ash plume. KLM Royal Dutch Airlines have also cancelled its Amsterdam-Delhi service (KL 871) and the return Delhi-Amsterdam flight (KL 872) due to the ash cloud.\n\nMeanwhile, IndiGo, in a post on X, said, âFollowing the recent eruption of the #HayliGubbi volcano in Ethiopia, ash clouds are reported to be drifting towards parts of western India. We understand that such news may cause concern, and we want to reassure you that your safety remains our highest priority.â\n\nAs a result of the volcanic ash cloud, IndiGoâs Kannur-Abu Dhabi 6E 1433 diverted to Ahmedabad on Monday afternoon to avoid flying into the route of the plumes.\n\nSpiceJet also noted on X, âDue to a volcanic eruption in Ethiopia, volcanic ash activity has been reported across parts of the Arabian Peninsula. This may impact flight operations for aircraft flying through these regions. As safety remains our top priority, our flight operations and safety teams are closely coordinating with aviation authorities and continuously monitoring ash cloud movement. Passengers travelling to/from Dubai (DXB) are advised to keep a check on their flight status,â adding that safety teams are coordinating with aviation authorities. Passengers travelling to and from Dubai have been advised to check their flight status.\n\nAn aviation official was quoted as tellingHindustan Timesthat the ministry officials as well as the DGCA were keeping a close eye on the matter. âIf the ashes settle over Delhi and Jaipur by Tuesday, Indian aviation is expected to be impacted severely,â he added.\n\nAir India also saw several of their flights cancelled on November 24 and November 25 as a result of the volcanic ash.\n\nThe Ethiopia volcano ash, which has made its way to India, has created a thin, hazy layer over parts of Delhi and Haryana, causing more concern of its impact on the already poor air pollution levels.\n\nHowever, officials have noted that the volcanic plume is not expected to significantly affect Delhiâs pollution levels, as it is travelling at very high altitudes. IMD director general M Mohapatra was quoted as tellingHindustan Timesthat âit was unclear whether it will impact air quality, but any significant impact is unlikely as it is at higher levels.â\n\nHe explained that the impact of the ash cloud would be mainly felt in aviation. He noted that since the plumes were in the âupper levels, its effect near the surface would be limitedâ. âThe skies will appear as hazy and cloudy,â he further said, adding that cities may also see âa marginal rise in the temperatureâ as the ash mass behaves like cloud cover.\n\nHowever, regardless of the volcanic eruption,Delhiâs air qualityremains a concern. On Tuesday morning, thick smog blanketed areas around India Gate and Kartavya Path, with the Air Quality Index (AQI) reading 328, categorised as âvery poorâ by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).\n\nFake fasting, or fasting mimicking diet (FMD), allows you to reap fasting benefits without going hungry by consuming small nutrient-dense meals. Developed by Professor Valter Longo, FMD supports cellular repair, reduces inflammation, and lowers insulin, promoting fat loss while preserving lean muscle. The diet includes plant-based soups, energy bars, and low-glycemic fruits, and can reduce diabetes risk factors and age-related illnesses.\n\nGet the latest stories delivered straight to your inbox.",

        "content": "A plume of volcanic ash from Ethiopia’s Hayli Gubbi volcano is likely to enter parts of western India on Tuesday and make its way to several northern states. The volcano erupted for the first time in 12,000 years.\n\nThe volcano, which rises about 500 metres in altitude, sits within the Rift Valley, a zone of intense geological activity where two tectonic plates meet.\n\nAccording to IndiaMetSky Weather, an ash cloud from the volcano will enter Gujarat and move towards Rajasthan, northwest Maharashtra, Delhi, Haryana, and Punjab by 10 pm today, and later it will impact the Himalayas and other regions.\n\nHayli Gubbi volcano sent thick plumes of smoke up to 14 kilometres (nine miles) into the sky after it erupted on Sunday and is moving at a speed of 100-120 km/h toward North India.\n\nIt is moving at altitudes ranging from 15,000â25,000 feet and up to 45,000 feet, carrying volcanic ash, sulphur dioxide, and fine particles of glass and rock. IndiaMetSky Weather warned that the ash could darken and haze the sky and potentially disrupt air traffic, leading to delays and longer flight times.\n\nThe historic eruption of the Ethiopian volcano has already disrupted West Asia-bound flights in India, with carriers like IndiGo and Akasa Air suspending operations on affected corridors.\n\nIn a statement, Akasa Air said that it had cancelled flights to and from Jeddah, Kuwait, and Abu Dhabi. “Our teams are closely monitoring the situation in line with international aviation advisories and safety protocols, and will take all necessary measures as required. At Akasa Air, the safety and well-being of our passengers remains our highest priority.”\n\nMeanwhile, IndiGo said, “Our teams are closely tracking the situation in coordination with international aviation bodies. We are fully prepared with all necessary precautions to ensure safe and reliable operations. Our 6E teams are available across all touchpoints to support you with any assistance you may need. We will continue to monitor the developments round the clock and keep you informed of any updates to help minimise inconvenience (if any).”\n\nThe Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) also instructed all Indian carriers to revise their flight plans, adjust fuel loads, and avoid any airspace or altitudes affected by the volcanic ash cloud from Ethiopiaâs Hayli Gubbi eruption.\n\nIn its advisory, the regulator directed airlines to ensure that flight crews and aircraft engineers follow all established safety protocols when operating in or near volcanic ash.\n\nMedical visas for Afghan citizens to India will restart soon. Afghan patients can approach the Indian Embassy in Kabul directly for medical visas. An Indian private hospital is set to open a branch in Afghanistan.\n\nGet the latest stories delivered straight to your inbox.",

The courtâs verdict permits them to drop all the criminal proceedings against them if they pay one-third of the dues, approximately Rs 1,500 crore by December 17, 2025, the Supreme Court order, published on its website on Friday.\n\nThis marks a significant verdict and development in the high-profile case linked to Sterling Biotech and other businesses promoted by the brothers.ÂÂ\n\nThe Sandesara brothers fled India in 2017 on Albanian passports after being accused of defaulting on massive domestic and overseas bank loans sanctioned by a consortium of Indian banks including Andhra Bank, UCO Bank, State Bank of India, Allahabad Bank, and Bank of India.ÂÂ\n\nThe loans were extended through various schemes involving other foreign branches as well. Investigation found that there was huge loss and financial irregularities alleging fraud with the funds.ÂÂ\n\nThe Supreme court observed that the primary objective was the recovery of the public money, and settle the amount, continuing the criminal proceedings. However, the court clarified that this case should not be treated as a precedent to the future cases.Â ÂÂ Â\n\nThe brothers’ lawyer, Mukul Rohatgi, said that they were agreeable to pay a settlement of $570 million, and set a December 17 deadline.ÂÂ\n\nIndia’s federal crime fighting agency accused the brothers, known for throwing lavish parties attended by Bollywood stars, of duping banks to the tune of $1.6 billion, though they denied the allegations.\n\nWhile facing multiple charges, under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and other legal provisions, the Sandesara brothers have consistently denied such accusations and wrongdoing.ÂÂ\n\nThe Sandesara settlement impact is closely watched as it raises important questions about Indiaâs handling of vast corporate frauds and balance between justice and financial recovery.ÂÂ\n\nThe ruling could open the way for economic offenders to strike similar settlements, leaving lenders struggling to recover their entire dues, said Debopriyo Moulik, a Supreme Court lawyer in independent practice.\n\nIndiGo flight from Mumbai to Dehradun suffered a bird strike during landing at Jolly Grant Airport, damaging the aircraft's nose. All 186 passengers on board were safe, and no injuries were reported. Airport authorities conducted a detailed inspection and safety audit of the runway following the incident.\n\nGet the latest stories delivered straight to your inbox.",

        "content": "An IndiGo Airbus A320 (flightâ¯IGOâ5032) flying from Mumbai to Dehradun suffered a suspected bird strike during landing at Jolly Grant Airport on Sunday evening, damaging the aircraftâs nose.\n\nThe incident occurred around 6:45â¯pm, when the plane collided with a bird near the runway. All 186 passengers on board were safe, and no injuries were reported.\n\nIn the wake of the strike, airport authorities carried out a detailed inspection and safety audit of the runway to assess any damage and ensure future safety.\n\nThis is the second birdâstrike incident reported at Jolly Grant Airport in about a month.\n\nAn IndiGo spokesperson issued a public statement following the event, explaining: âCaused due to bird hit, a maintenance requirement was noticed on IndiGo flightâ¯6Eâ¯5032, operating from Mumbai to Dehradun â¦ the aircraft was subsequently grounded and an alternative flight was arranged to operate the sector.â The airline also assured that all âoperational and safety protocols were followed.â\n\nâAll 186 passengers on board remained unharmed,â the statement said.\n\nBird strikes are a persistent concern for many airports, especially those surrounded by natural habitat. Experts say that even a relatively small bird can cause significant damage to an aircraftâs nose, windshield, or engines during takeoff or landing.\n\nWith repeated incidents at Jolly Grant, aviation authorities may now face increasing pressure to step up birdâhazard mitigation measuresâfrom habitat management around the airfield to active wildlife deterrenceâto prevent such incidents in the future.\n\nAt least 15 protesters arrested for using pepper spray against police during Delhi-NCR air pollution protest.

        "title": "India, Canada to resume FTA talks with target of USD 50 billion by 2030: Piyush Goyal",
        "content": "India and Canada have agreed to resume negotiations for a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with an aim to increase the two-way trade to USD 50 billion by 2030, according to Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal.\n\nAn FTA or Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) has many strategic elements to it and it is a demonstration of the trust between the two countries, Goyal said here at an event on Monday.\n\nThe pact would give confidence to investors, businesses of both sides, he said.\n\n“We have agreed to begin negotiations on a high-ambition CEPA and double the trade between the two nations by 2030,” he said, adding the two countries are natural allies and do not compete with each other.\n\nThe strengths of India and Canada can become a force multiplier for businesses and investors, Goyal said.\n\n“There is a lot that we can learn from Canada and a lot we can offer Canada. There is a lot of potential on critical minerals, critical minerals processing technologies. There is a good possibility on nuclear energy - particularly with our engagement with Canada on Uranium supplies,” he said adding “we can diversify our supply chains on both sides”.\n\nIn 2023, Canada had paused negotiations for a free trade agreement with India. The India-Canada relations hit rock bottom following then Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s allegations in 2023 of a potential Indian link to the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar. India had dismissed Trudeau’s accusation as “absurd”.\n\nIn March 2022, the two countries had re-launched negotiations for an interim agreement, officially dubbed as Early Progress Trade Agreement (EPTA).\n\nOver half a dozen rounds of talks have been held on the trade pact so far.\n\nNormally in a trade agreement, two countries significantly reduce or eliminate customs duties on the maximum number of goods traded between them. They also liberalise norms for promoting trade in services and attract investments.\n\nIndia’s exports to Canada rose 9.8 per cent to USD 4.22 billion in 2024-25 from USD 3.84 billion in 2023-24. Imports, however, dipped 2.33 per cent to USD 4.44 billion in the last fiscal year from USD 4.55 billion in 2023-24.\n\nThe renewed vibrancy in ties between the two countries followed Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s talks with his Canadian counterpart Mark Carney on the margins of the G7 summit at Canada’s Kananaskis in June.\n\nBilateral trade in goods and services between India and Canada stood at USD 18.38 billion in 2023.\n\nThere are about 2.9 million Indian diaspora and over 4,27,000 Indian students in Canada.\n\nTo give an impetus to trade ties, Goyal has held two rounds of discussions with Canada’s Minister of Export Promotion, International Trade and Economic Development Maninder Sidhu.\n\nSidhu was here recently. Both the ministers co-chaired the India-Canada Ministerial Dialogue on Trade and Investment (MDTI) meeting here earlier this month.\n\n“We can focus on emerging technologies like AI (artificial intelligence) with data centres, quantum computing, machine learning, all new age technologies where India has very strategic benefits to offer for investors looking to leverage on the AI emerging technologies,” Goyal said.\n\nHe stressed the need to translate dialogue between the two countries into concrete outcomes.\n\nThe minister also asked for having actionable outcomes, a game plan, a sectoral roadmap, and measurable progress.\n\n“We must activate the CEO forum and resume the forum in the first quarter of 2026 because business to business contact will help governmental relations,” Goyal said, adding that the ACITI (Australia-Canada-India Technology and Innovation) partnership should be taken forward with all seriousness.\n\n“We could look at joint innovation,” he said, adding there is a need to identify focus areas where both sides can enhance collaborations such as critical minerals, critical energy, aerospace and defence capabilities, and manufacturing in India.\n\nAt least 15 protesters arrested for using pepper spray against police during Delhi-NCR air pollution protest.

        "title": "‘Tejas crash isolated occurrence’: HAL says Dubai mishap has no impact on business ops, future deliveries",
        "content": "Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) on Monday issued a fresh statement following the fatal crash of a Tejas fighter jet during an aerial display at the Dubai Air Show, calling the incident âisolatedâ and downplaying any larger business impact.\n\nThe company said it âwould like to assure that there is no impact on the Companyâs business operations, financial performance or its future deliveries.â HAL added that it is extending âfull support and cooperation to the agencies conducting the investigation,â and promised to keep all stakeholders âinformed of any development.â\n\nThe Tejas, an indigenously built light combat aircraft, went down in a fiery crash on November 21 at Al Maktoum International Airport while performing a low-altitude aerial display, killing the pilotNamansh Syal. Videos from the show captured the jet suddenly losing altitude and plunging into the ground, followed by a massive fireball and thick black smoke.\n\nA deeply painful moment for Indian aviation. Watching Tejas crash with no sign of ejection is something that leaves you shaken. Our pilots carry the nationâs pride every time they fly, and seeing this feels like a punch to the heart. Still waiting for clarity, but the visualsâ¦pic.twitter.com/BDlJhnC4k4\n\nThe UAE Ministry of Defence confirmed the crash. In India, the Air Force said it haslaunched a court of inquiryto determine the cause of the accident. Some defence experts have suggested the plane may have suffered a âG-force blackoutââa loss of consciousness due to intense gravitational forces during high-G maneuvers.\n\nAlso read |Tejas crash in Dubai: Who was IAF Wing Commander Namansh Syal, the pilot India lost?\n\nInvestors have reacted strongly to this mishap. HALâs share price tumbled by up to 9%, dropping as low as Rs 4,205 on the BSE, amid concerns over reputational damage and the possible impact on exports. By mid-session, the stock had recovered partially but was still down roughly 3.6%, trading around Rs 4,430.\n\nMarket analysts called the reaction âlargely sentiment-driven.â Some said that unless the investigation reveals a major technical flaw, HALâs strong order bookâincluding large pending orders for Tejas Mk-1A jetsâcould help the company rebound.\n\nAt least 15 protesters arrested for using pepper spray against police during Delhi-NCR air pollution protest.

        "title": "Delhi air pollution protest turns violent: 22 arrested after pepper-spraying on-duty cops",
        "content": "A protest over rising air pollution in Delhi-NCR took a sharp turn on Sunday when at least 22 protesters were arrested for allegedly using pepper spray against police officers, authorities said.\n\nThe protest unfolded at the C-hexagon near India Gate, where protesters had gathered to demand stronger government intervention amid dangerously poor air quality. According to police, the group refused repeated orders to disperse and attempted to breach barricades installed to control movement.\n\nOfficers say they warned the crowd that ambulances and medical personnel were blocked by the protesters and needed unfettered access. But when demonstrators ignored the warnings and sat down on the road, tensions escalated.\n\nâAs we tried to remove them, some protesters attacked police personnel using chilli spray,â Deputy Commissioner of Police Devesh Kumar Mahla, toldIANS.\n\n“This matter is also under thorough investigation, and strict action will certainly be taken… An FIR has been registered under various sections, including against the use of force against the police, road blockades, and the use of chilli spray,” he said.\n\nHe added that three to four officers suffered irritation in their eyes and faces and were admitted to Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital for treatment.\n\n#WATCH| Delhi: A group of protesters holds a protest at India Gate over air pollution in Delhi-NCR. They were later removed from the spot by police personnelpic.twitter.com/DBEZTeET0U\n\nTwo First Information Reports (FIRs) has been filed under multiple legal sections, including âobstruction of government work,â according to officials.\n\nAt Kartavya Path Police Station, six male protesters have been arrested under BNS sections 74, 79, 115(2), 132, 221, 223, and 61(2). The second FIR has been registered at Sansad Marg Police Station, in which other protesters have been arrested. They have been booked under BNS sections 223A, 132, 221, 121A, 126(2), and 3(5).\n\nDelhi Police say this appears to be the first instance of demonstrators using pepper or chilli spray during a crowd-control operation in the capital.\n\nThe Delhi Coordination Committee for Clean Air, a prominent protest organiser, slammed the arrests in a statement. The group warned that the cityâs toxic air is now a âserious riskâ to public health and accused authorities of relying on superficial measuresâlike water sprinklers, cloud seeding, and spot sprayingârather than tackling the deep-rooted causes of pollution.\n\nThe incident comes just days after earlier protests at India Gate, where protestors had already voiced frustration over what they called an âair emergencyâ in the capital.\n\nHAL issues statement after Tejas fighter jet crash at Dubai Air Show, calling the incident isolated. Pilot Namansh Syal killed in fiery crash during low-altitude aerial display at Al Maktoum International Airport.

        "title": "Tejas crash: IAF team in Dubai for joint probe, expert warn against social media speculation",
        "content": "An Indian Air ForceTejasfighter jet executing an aerial manoeuvre at the Dubai Airshow suddenly appeared to lose control, plunging to the ground moments later at 2:08 pm local time on Friday. Amid a plume of thick black smoke, the pilot of the aircraftâWing Commander Namansh Syalâwho maintained an almost flawless safety recordâwas killed, theIAFconfirmed. Soon after the crash, several hashtags gained momentum online, amplifying theories about sabotage and external interference.\n\nA fabricated social media post also alleged that an oil leak had been detected on the Tejas before the flight. However, a Press Information Bureau Fact Check dismissed the claim as false, clarifying that the fluid seen in the video formed part of a routine draining process and not a technical malfunction.\n\nA senior official tracking misinformation campaigns said multiple accounts â operating from neighbouring countries â had circulated misleading narratives about the crash. The increased military cooperation between China and Pakistan, particularly in defence technology, has also been repeatedly referenced in online discussions around the incident. Aviation experts, however, cautioned against drawing conclusions before the joint investigation report is released.\n\nâIndian Air Force has full confidence in the aircraft; that is why they are flying it. The only issue is Hindustan Aeronautics Limitedâs inability to meet delivery timelines. If we cannot meet our own timelines, how can we export?â said Air Vice Marshal Anil Golani (retired), Director General of the Centre for Air Power Studies. He added that incidents during development or early induction phases are not unusual. âTejas has had an impeccable record. It was inducted in 2016, and till 2024 not a single incident occurred. Its safety record is excellent.â\n\nOn the export prospects of Tejas, he said India must first meet domestic requirements. âOur first priority should be to fulfil our own needs. Indian Air Force has already placed orders for 220 Tejas aircraft. There are many powers in the world trying to pull India down.â\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Defence, Indiaâs indigenous defence production touched a record Rs 1,27,434 crore in the financial year 2023â24, marking a 174% rise from 2014â15. India now exports military equipment to more than 100 countries, including the United States, France, and Armenia. Defence public sector undertakings accounted for 77% of total output, while the private sector contributed 23%.\n\nWith the retirement of its last MiG-21 squadronsâNo. 23 Panthers and No. 3 Cobrasâthe Indian Air Forceâs strength has reduced to 29 fighter squadrons, its lowest since the 1960s, against a sanctioned 42. To cover the shortfall, the force is relying heavily on the phased induction of the Tejas. The aircraft currently serves with No. 45 Flying Daggers and No. 18 Flying Bullets at Sulur, with additional squadrons planned.\n\nThe upgraded Tejas Mk-1A, featuring advanced radar, enhanced electronic warfare systems, and improved maintainability, is expected to significantly bolster capability. However, delivery delays continue. In February, Indian Air Force Chief Air Chief Marshal A. P. Singh criticised Hindustan Aeronautics Limited for slipping schedules. âHungry mouths are ready; we are waiting for the food,â he said, emphasising that the force requires at least 30â40 aircraft every year to sustain optimal squadron strength.\n\nOn 17 October, the first Light Combat Aircraft Tejas Mark 1A from the new Nashik production line carried out its maiden flight but is still awaiting induction. Meanwhile, the more advanced Light Combat Aircraft Mk-2 â intended to replace the Mirage-2000, Jaguar, and MiG-29 fleets â remains under development. First conceptualised in 2012, its prototype has faced repeated delays, with production now expected around 2026.\n\nJustice Surya Kant took oath as the 53rd Chief Justice of India, succeeding Justice B R Gavai. Appointed under Article 124(2), Kant will serve until February 2027. Known for major verdicts, including Article 370 abrogation and Pegasus probe, he has a distinguished judicial career.\n\nGet the latest stories delivered straight to your inbox.",

        "title": "‘Must send a message’: PM Modi calls for UNSC reform and stronger anti-terror fight",
        "content": "Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi participated in the IBSA Leadersâ Meeting on the margins of theG20summit, underlining that reform of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) is imperative. He further emphasised that there should be no room for double standards in combating terrorism.\n\nPM Modi joined the trilateral meeting hosted by South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and attended by Brazilâs President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. While all three countries have experienced challenges in relations with the United States under President Donald Trump, diplomatic sources downplayed suggestions that the meeting was aimed at responding to the Americans, noting that a substantive IBSA summit was also held on the margins of the 2024 G20 summit in Rio.\n\nThe United States boycotted the G20 summit in South Africa, citing alleged mistreatment of white Afrikaners. PM Modi highlighted that global institutions do not reflect the realities of the twenty-first century. âNone of us is a permanent member of the UN Security Council. This clearly demonstrates that global institutions no longer represent todayâs world. Therefore, IBSA must send a unified message to the world: institutional reform is not an option but imperative,â he said.\n\nHe added, âSimilarly, we must work in close coordination in the fight against terrorism. On an issue of such gravity, there can be no room for double standards. For the sake of global peace and prosperity, united and decisive action is essential,â and proposed institutionalising NSA-level meetings among the three countries to strengthen security cooperation.\n\nDescribing the meeting as timely, PM Modi noted it coincided with the first G20 summit held on African soil and marked the conclusion of four consecutive G20 presidencies by Global South countries, of which the last three were held by IBSA members. He said this had led to several initiatives focused on human-centric development, multilateral reform, and sustainable growth.\n\nPM Modi emphasised that IBSA is more than a group of three nations; it is a platform connecting three continents, three major democracies, and three major economies. Highlighting technologyâs crucial role in human-centric development, he proposed an âIBSA Digital Innovation Allianceâ to facilitate the sharing of digital public infrastructure such as the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), health platforms like CoWIN, cybersecurity frameworks, and women-led technology initiatives. He also highlighted IBSAâs potential to contribute to the development of safe, trustworthy, and human-centric AI norms, inviting leaders to the next yearâs AI summit.\n\nAppreciating the IBSA Fundâs work in supporting projects across forty countries in sectors such as education, health, womenâs empowerment, and solar energy, PM Modi proposed establishing an IBSA Fund for Climate Resilient Agriculture to further advance South-South Cooperation.\n\nDefence Minister Rajnath Singh emphasized the deep civilisational and cultural ties between India and the Sindh region, suggesting it could return to India someday.

        "title": "'Borders can change': Rajnath Singh says Sindh may ‘return’ someday, cites civilisational link",
        "content": "Defence Minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said that while the Sindh region is not part of India today, it remains deeply connected to the country through civilisational and cultural ties â and could even return to India someday.\n\nSpeaking at an event, Singh said the province of Sindh, located along the Indus River, went to Pakistan after the 1947 Partition, forcing large numbers of Sindhi Hindus to migrate to India. The region shares a border with Gujarat and Rajasthan.\n\nQuoting former Deputy Prime Minister LK Advani, who was born in Sindh, Singh said Sindhi Hindus of that generation had never emotionally accepted the separation of Sindh from India because of their reverence for the Indus River.\n\nâIâd like to recall Advani jiâs words â that Sindhi Hindus, especially those of his generation, still havenât accepted Sindhâs separation from India,â Singh said. âFor Hindus across India, the Indus River has always been sacred. Many Muslims in Sindh also believed that the Indus was no less holy than the Aab-e-Zamzam of Mecca.â\n\n#WATCH| Delhi: Defence Minister Rajnath Singh says, \"...Today, the land of Sindh may not be a part of India, but civilisationally, Sindh will always be a part of India. And as far as land is concerned, borders can change. Who knows, tomorrow Sindh may return to India again...\"â¦pic.twitter.com/9Wp1zorTMt\n\nSingh added that the cultural bond between India and Sindh remains intact. âToday, the land of Sindh may not be part of India, but civilisationally, it will always belong to us. As far as territory is concerned, borders can change. Who knows â tomorrow, Sindh may return to India again. The people of Sindh, who hold the Indus River sacred, will always be our own.â\n\nHe also praised the Sindhi community in India, saying they rebuilt their lives from scratch after the trauma of Partition and have since made significant contributions to Indiaâs economic and social development.\n\nSingh had made similar remarks last month in Morocco while addressing the Indian community there. He said growing discontent in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) could eventually lead to its merger with India without any military action.\n\nâPoK will be ours on its own,â he said. âDemands have already begun. You must have heard the sloganeering.â Recalling his address to the Indian Army in Kashmir five years ago, Singh added: âI had said then that we will not need to attack PoK. It is anyway ours â and one day, PoK itself will say, âMain bhi Bharat hoonâ. That day will come.â\n\nWing Commander Namansh Syal, who died in a Tejas LCA crash during the Dubai Airshow, was laid to rest in his native village in Himachal Pradesh.

        "title": "Operation Sindoor was a ‘trusted orchestra’ where every musician played a synergistic role, says Army chief",
        "content": "Army Chief Gen. Upendra Dwivedi on Saturday called OperationSindooras a âtrusted orchestraâ in which every unit played a âsimultaneous or synergistic roleâ, enabling the Indian armed forces to destroy nine terrorist targets within 22 minutes.\n\nSpeaking at a convocation ceremony at a Delhi-based management institute, he said the operation demonstrated the militaryâs âforesightâ in anticipating how the situation would evolve.\n\nIt was âa response shaped not in the moment, but through years of imagining how intelligence, precision and technology could converge into action,â he added.\n\nIndia launched OperationSindoorin the early hours of May 7, targeting and dismantling multiple terror infrastructures in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK).\n\nPakistan also launched offensives against India, and all subsequent counter-offensives by India were also carried out under Operation Sindoor.\n\nThe military conflict between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, lasting nearly 88 hours, halted after they reached an understanding on the evening of May 10.\n\nâOp Sindoor was a trusted orchestra where every musician played a simultaneous or a synergistic role. That is how in 22 minutes, we could destroy nine terrorist targets and, we could in 80 hours make sure that the battle comes to an end. But what is more important, there was no time for decision making, had we not visualised, and had we not trusted the entire team,â the Army chief said.\n\nIn his address at the ceremony hosted by New Delhi Institute of Management (NDIM) here, Gen Dwivedi told the gathering of graduating students to lead with âwisdom, humility and powerâ.\n\nâSo as you step forward today, remember the world will never stand still, markets will shift, technology will evolve, and your own ambitions will also change. Yet within that motion lies your greatest strength, the courage to learn, the agility to adapt, and the vision to lead with a purpose. Change is not what happens to us, itâs what we choose to become through it,â he said.\n\nThe generalâs address was themed on âNavigating Change: The Real Constantâ and he touched upon the aspects of evolving global dynamics, technology as a disruptive force and reflections for the road ahead.\n\nâAs the 21st century unfolded, long peace yielded to a contested landscape of competition, contestation and conflicts. As across the world today over 55 conflicts today rage on, drawing in more than 100 nations, directly or indirectly, therefore blurring the boundary between peace and conflict,â he said.\n\nAnd, as battlefields blurred, so did the markets, the Army chief said.\n\nâThe rise of nationalism, protectionism and sanctions led to the emergence of geoeconomics, a framework articulated by Edward Luttwak, who described it as a logic of war expressed through the grammar of commerce,â he emphasised.\n\nThe Army chief said that today, the six chapters of grammar book are different from the traditional Wren and Martinâs English grammar book. It contains âcooperation, collaboration, co-existence, competition, contestation and the conflict itselfâ.\n\nâSo, these are the 6Cs, which we have to know together. Because, in our strategic dealings also, we deal with the 6Cs, and you also in the future will be dealing with these,â he added.\n\nThe Army chief underlined the importance of technology in military evolution.\n\nâTechnology has transformed warfare, ranging from muddy trenches to intelligent network, rifles to drones, boots to bots, and also revolutions businesses, shampoo sachets to Gemini,â he added.\n\nHe also emphasised the need for adaptation and what he described in the context of change as âa velocity of relevanceâ.\n\nâRecognising opportunity is one thing, responding to it is another. And that response begins with the courage to embrace change before it compels you to change. When I was commissioned into the Army, computers were nowhere in the horizon in our Army. And here I stand today, leading an Army that applies data sciences and AI in modern war fighting,â Gen Dwivedi said.\n\nHe said the transformation journey in the Army includes restructuring the force for greater agility, deepening jointness with the Navy, Air Force and other domains, accelerating modernisation through cutting-edge technologies, reforming human resource system and continuously refining our system processes and functions to enhance efficiency and responsiveness.\n\nGeneral Dwivedi said that today he is leading âa community of approximately 1.3 crore soldiers, veterans and familiesâ and that happens to be one per cent of the Indian population.\n\nâAs I often tell my friends in the corporate world, that while they handle a few hundred resumes, we handle a few million lives, who are ready to walk into a hail of bullets on your one clarion call.â He also spoke of seeking an opportunity in times of turbulence.\n\nâLet me begin with one that has served the Indian Army well, the ability to find opportunity in uncertainty. In 1971, when turmoil in us, while East Pakistan turned a tide of refugees, creating regional instability, India turned crisis into liberation, reshaping the subcontinentâs destiny,â the officer said.\n\nOn leadership, he said, âWhether on the battlefield or in the board rooms, speed and success come not from control but from trust.\n\nâYour ability to identify the sweet spot between the centralised, controlled, and delegation while owning up the accountability or ownership for all actions or results, whether good or bad. This is what makes you a great leader.â\n\nAn Indian Air Force Tejas fighter jet crashed at the Dubai Air Show. Unverified visuals are circulating on social media.

        "content": "Al-Falah University, which has been under the scanner over the Delhi blast case, has said that an outdated accreditation displayed on its website was an “oversight” after the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC) sent a show-cause notice to the institution.\n\nResponding to NAAC’s notice, the university confirmed that the information about its accreditation has now been removed from the website, adding that it regrets the “website design error”.\n\nThe university is associated with the Red Fort blast case as the suicide bomber Dr Umar Nabi and another accused, Muzammil Shakeel Ganai, worked at Al-Falah. Probe into the educational institution’s day-to-day dealings has revealed a number of incriminating activities that were being conducted by the university authorities.\n\nThe Enforcement Directorate is running a separate probe into the university after it alleged financial irregularities at the Al-Falah group, the organisation that operates the university, a hospital and a medical college in Faridabad.\n\nSources from the ED have told theTimes of Indiathat significant sums of money, running into crores of rupees, were allegedly diverted to companies linked to the family of Jawad Ahmed Siddiqui, chairman of the group. According to the ED, contracts for construction and catering services were awarded to firms owned by Siddiquiâs relatives.\n\nSiddiqui was arrested earlier this week under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) after searches were carried out at 25 locations connected to the group. During the raids, investigators reportedly recovered over Rs 48 lakh in cash, along with several digital devices and documents that suggest the existence of shell companies and potential fund diversion schemes. The probe is ongoing as the ED continues to examine the financial transactions linked to these alleged irregularities.\n\nThe National Commission for Minority Educational Institutions (NCMEI) has issued a show-cause notice to the Al-Falah University, asking why its minority status should not be withdrawn in light of linkages to the Delhi blast case, sources toldÂANI.\n\nNCMEI sources said that on Friday, they issued the notice, and the matter has been scheduled for a hearing on December 4. Notice has been issued to the university registrar as well as the Principal Secretary to the Education Department in Haryana to submit the report.\n\nArticle 30(1) of the Constitution of India provides for linguistic and religious minorities a fundamental right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. The NCMEI is a quasi-judicial body and has been endowed with adjudicatory, advisory, and recommendatory powers for this purpose.

        "title": "Exclusive | Behind the gates of Rashtrapati Bhavan: A rare look at the horses of the President’s Bodyguard",
        "content": "On a warm late-autumn afternoon, the sun slanted through the open stable corridors just beyond Gate no. 24 of the Rashtrapati Bhavan.\n\nThis is the Presidentâs Bodyguard (PBG) lines, the heart of Indiaâs oldest mounted unit, where an ancient tradition is lived, breathed, and meticulously maintained every single day.\n\nFirstpostgained rare access to these exclusive stables within the presidential estate to understand the emotional and institutional meaning of the animals that form the mounted regiment.\n\nWithin this remarkable setting, where the most significant ceremonies of the worldâs largest democracy are conceived and prepared, stand the horses â majestic, disciplined, and utterly central to the regimentâs identity.\n\nThe story of the PBG, therefore, is not merely a military narrative; it is an intimate tale of equine excellence, unbroken martial tradition, and a deep, almost spiritual bond between human and animal.\n\nThe insight into this unique world comes directly from Colonel Amit Berwal, Commandant of the Presidentâs Bodyguard, who has been posted at the Rashtrapati Bhavan since February 2023, speaking toFirstpost’s Anmol Singlaabout the unitâs philosophy and future.\n\nThe Presidentâs Bodyguard is unlike any other military unit in India. It is the first uniformed presence visible to any incoming head of state, tasked with presenting an image of Indiaâs poise, discipline, and historical grandeur.\n\nThis responsibility is carried on the backs of its ceremonial mounts.\n\nThe PBG is the oldest and senior-most unit of the Indian Army, maintaining the prestigious distinction as the âRight of the Lineâ.\n\nIt was originally raised in 1773 when Raja Chet [Chait] Singh of Varanasi (formerly known as Benaras) provided 50 horses and 50 men to the then-Governor-General Warren Hastings.\n\nIn 1950, after India became a Republic, the unit formally became the Presidentâs Bodyguard, which coincidentally are now celebrating 75 years being designated as.\n\nThe PBGâs ceremonial role, while modern in its political context, is deeply steeped in this historical martial heritage.\n\nThe regiment stands ready to execute any critical diplomatic function during state visits at a moment’s notice, such as the arrival ceremony of a visiting head of state.\n\nâWe present the national salute, there’s a contingent of horses there and we have two and a half minutes to thereafter escort the incoming head of state in front of our Honourable President and the PM,â Berwal revealed toFirstpost.\n\nThe horses are the defining visual element of this moment. They must communicate Indiaâs dignity, discipline, and power.\n\nâSo our salute, our drill, the disposition of our horses and the whole package must be such that the incoming person must get a sort of an introduction of what Indians are, what is India all about and you have to sort of make sure that the person is in awe of India.â\n\nNot just any horse can carry the weight of the nationâs ceremonial duties. The PBG mounts are an elite class of their own, bred and trained for specific attributes that place majesty and composure above all else.\n\nThey are dramatically different from their more agile counterparts, the polo ponies.\n\nThese ceremonial giants, often Hanoverian and warmblood horses, are large, disciplined, and trained to remain unflinchingly calm amidst the flashing lights, deafening sounds, and massive crowds of national events.\n\nBerwal stressed the required physical profile needed for this imposing ceremonial display.\n\nâSo our horses must be like that. They must be tall, handsome, big,â he noted.\n\nThe physical difference between a ceremonial mount and a sporting horse is stark, measured in hundreds of kilogrammes. The mounts are specially configured for precision and bearing, sacrificing the quick movements required for sport.\n\nâThey are at least 250 kgs heavier than a normal polo horse which you see,â the Commandant revealed. âPolo can’t be played on big tall horses because these horses have a different configuration.â\n\nCeremonial horses must move in slow, precise cohesion, commanding attention without betraying a single flicker of nervousness. Agility and acceleration, the core attributes of a battlefield or polo horse, are not their primary requirements.\n\nEvery stable has its star, and in the PBG, that star is Virat.\n\nA Hanoverian warmblood, Virat is 25 years old â an ancient age by Indian standards â and holds the distinction of being the most decorated horse in the regiment, a true legend.\n\nThe horse has stood before presidents, prime ministers, state dignitaries, and thousands of spectators along Rajpath for more than a decade.\n\nâVirat has done 13 Republic Day parades,â Berwal shared, noting the immense pressure this involves, which includes âabout 45 to 50 days of gruelling practise on tarmac.â\n\nâHe has been awarded a commendation card by the COAS [Chief of the Army Staff] in 2022,â Berwal said. The ultimate honour, however, came during one of the most visible moments on the national calendar.\n\nâHe’s been patted personally on parade during the 26th January celebrations by the then Honourable President and the PM.â\n\nRetired at the age of 22, Virat now lives out his years in dignified, cherished comfort within the PBG stables, enjoying a âvery special statusâ that is a testament to the regimentâs reverence for service.\n\nIn an age of drone warfare and mechanised battalions, the emphasis on horsemanship within the Indian Army, and particularly the PBG, might seem anachronistic.\n\nBerwal argues the exact opposite: equitation is not a relic; it is a vital component of leadership training. It is a training that allows soldiers to overcome fears and develop confidence by being in sync with a non-verbal animal.\n\nâAny worthwhile army or institution in the world has got equitation as part of its leadership programme,â he asserted, citing even the training of civil servants at the IAS academy in Mussoorie.\n\nThe reason is simple and profound: interacting with a horse builds character essential for command.\n\nâIt lets you overcome your fears. It helps you become confident. It helps you understand an animal who cannot speak, be in sync with it, have empathy, sympathy.â\n\nHorsemanship demands discipline, composure under stress, swift decision-making, and emotional restraint â traits that define a successful leader. The Commandant draws a direct line between equestrian skill and moral fibre, suggesting that riders possess an inherent gentleness and restraint.\n\nâYou will seldom come across good riders who are not gentlemen or who are not perfect ladies. They will seldom be irrational. They will always have a lot of sympathy, empathy, good people and horses have a good role and an effective role to sort of shape their personalities.â\n\nIf ceremony is the PBGâs external display, then polo is its internal laboratory â a continuation of martial lineage disguised as a sport.\n\nPolo has been inseparable from the Indian cavalry tradition for centuries, having originated as a traditional sport in Manipur and Ladakh before being formalised by the army.\n\nBerwal, a top polo player himself, explained that the army adopted polo because it provides an excellent opportunity to train a rider and a horse to the situations they might face on a battlefield, demanding agility, balance, timing, coordination, and situational awareness.\n\nEven after cavalry charges vanished, the sportâs utility for training readiness persisted.\n\nIt simulates the chaos of war â demanding rapid acceleration, sudden turns, balance, timing, and split-second intuition between rider and mount.\n\nToday, the PBG is actively working to restore its standing in the sport.\n\nâWe are now trying to revive polo in the PBG after a short gap,â the Commandant stated.\n\nTill date, coinciding with the Indian polo season, the Presidentâs Bodyguard (PBG) Parade Groundwitnesses the Presidentâs Polo Cup every year,attended by none other than the President of India.\n\nThis revival is significant, signalling a renewed commitment to a tradition that saw the Indian Polo Association itself operate from within Rashtrapati Bhavan until 2004.\n\nThe polo horses needed for this revival are a different breed entirely.\n\nThey must be configured for speed and agility, not bulk.\n\nThe Commandant noted that competitive polo horses require a short turning radius, explosive speed, and the ability to stop instantly.\n\nâFor polo you need a very agile, flexible horse with a very short turning radius, a horse which can almost instantly stop, turn back on its hind quarters again with an exploding speed, and accelerate rapidly,â Berwal explained.\n\nTo achieve this level of competitive speed, the PBG is strategically adapting its breeding and procurement policies. Traditionally, the army relied on its own bred horses, but the need for competitive quality is leading to a new approach involving faster lines.\n\nâWe are now being permitted to look at thoroughbreds to play for polo. I am sure in times to come we should be able to produce speed and quality of game which is now available in the city street,â he toldFirstpost.\n\nThis strategic ambition is supported by the highest levels of the institution, ensuring alignment between ceremonial duties and sporting goals.\n\nâThere is a lot of support from the army… and we have all the required support from Rashtrapati Bhavan for all initiatives which are in good faith for the welfare of horses and for the welfare of troops.â\n\nBeneath the gleam of ceremonial brass and the blur of the polo field lies the quiet foundation of the entire institution: the relationship between the rider and the horse.\n\nThis relationship, according to the Commandant, is one of total, dependent trust, exceeding professional routine.\n\nâTending to a horse is like tending to your child,â Berwal admitted. âThe horse is completely dependent on the human athlete.â\n\nHe elaborated on the horseâs inherent vulnerability, pointing out that anatomically, they lack the offensive capability of carnivores.\n\nâThe horses don’t have claws… They don’t have nails… The horses don’t have canines like the carnivores. They can bite you but they can’t bite you to kill you and eat you.â Their evolutionary instincts favour flight, not fight, making the rider the ultimate protector and guide.\n\nIts survival, especially in stressful or chaotic situations, hinges entirely on the human rider’s judgement, composure, and care.\n\nâSo, if the rider and the horse are in unison, they can do wonders. That is the kind of care which you must give to the horse and that is the kind of care which the horse expects.â\n\nThe consequence of a lapse in this bond is immediate and profound, leading to loss of performance and trust. âIf there’s a disconnect, then there’s loss of performance. There’s loss of faith.â\n\nThis high-stakes dependency â in which a horse will only stop when it physically “cannot move any further” â makes the PBGâs daily routine a continuous practice of responsibility.\n\nA common public misconception is that old military horses are disposed of or euthanised. Berwal categorically dismissed this notion, stating the institution’s commitment to dignity in retirement.\n\nâA horse dies as peacefully and naturally as possible… just like a human being.

        "title": "What is ORS and what it not, and why you must know",
        "content": "Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS) is a simple yet lifesaving treatment for dehydration. Developed by World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF, it is used worldwide to treat fluid loss from diarrhoea, severe vomiting or heat-related illness.\n\nBut recent regulatory action in India has placed a spotlight on how the term âORSâ is being misused and why consumers must pay attention.\n\nAn authentic ORS is a precisely formulated mixture of clean water, glucose and specific electrolytes â primarily sodium and potassium, designed to optimise fluid and salt absorption in the bodyâs intestines.\n\nWHO estimates that ORS has prevented millions of deaths from diarrhoeal disease in children globally.\n\nIn short, it is a medically regulated âdrug-equivalentâ solution, not just another sports or hydration drink.\n\nDespite this, many fruit-based beverages, ready-to-serve drinks, electrolyte drinks and energy drinks in India have been branded or labelled as âORSâ despite not meeting the required composition. The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) says that the term âORSâ is being misused in product names, labels or trademarks, misleading consumers into thinking they are buying a medically effective solution when they are not.\n\nOn 20 November 2025, the FSSAI ordered the immediate removal of such beverages from retail and e-commerce platforms, citing the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006.\n\nUsing a drink labelled âORSâ that does not confirm to the true formulation can pose health risks, particularly in children, the elderly or those with underlying conditions. Genuine ORS is calibrated for rehydration; sugary drinks or sports drinks do not substitute effectively and may even worsen dehydration or electrolyte imbalance.\n\nFor example, when children with acute diarrhoea receive inadequate rehydration, the absence of a medically appropriate ORS can increase the risk of complications.\n\nFSSAIâs directive explains that only WHO-recommended ORS products, classified as âdrugsâ under the Drugs & Cosmetics Act, 1940, fall outside FSSAIâs purview as foods; all other âORS-taggedâ beverages must be removed.\n\nState food safety officers have been instructed to conduct inspections across e-commerce platforms and retail stores, identify products misusing the term âORSâ, remove them immediately and report actions taken.\n\nCheck whether a product labelled âORSâ is truly a medically approved formulation. If it is simply a fruit drink or electrolyte beverage calling itself âORSâ, it may not be genuine.\n\nLook for official ORS packets from trusted brands or consult pharmacists, particularly for children under five and patients with diarrhoea.\n\nAvoid substituting sports drinks, soda or fruit juices when treating dehydration caused by illness. Water and a medically approved ORS are safer.\n\nReport mis-labelled products to local food safety authorities.\n\nWhile ORS remains one of the most effective tools in global health for preventing dehydration-related deaths, its proper use depends on accurate formulation and appropriate conditions. The recent crackdown by FSSAI in India highlights that not every âORS-labelledâ drink is equal. Consumers must distinguish between genuine therapeutic solutions and misleading products that may carry the name but not the substance.\n\nAn Indian Air Force Tejas fighter jet crashed at the Dubai Air Show.

        "title": "‘School did this to me’: The tragic story of 16-year-old Delhi boy who died by suicide",
        "content": "In a deeply tragic incident, a 16-year-old Class 10 student from St Columbaâs School in Delhi died by suicide after jumping from the Rajendra Place Metro Station.\n\nBefore taking the step on November 18, the teen left behind a heartbreaking note, where he accused his teachers and the school headmaster of constant humiliation and mental harassment.\n\nThe incident has sparked shock and anger across the city. Two days later, a group of parents, neighbours and family friends gathered outside the school in LutyensâDelhi, demanding answers and justice for the boy. They are also demanding the arrest of teachers.\n\nIn his final note, Shourya wrote directly to his family, apologising and explaining the emotional burden he had been carrying. âSorry mummy, aapka itni bar dil toda, ab last bar todunga. School ki teachers ab hai hi aise, kya bolu,â (Sorry mummy, I broke your heart many times and I am doing it for the last time. This is how the teachers in the school are, what do I say?)\", he wrote.\n\nHe also apologised to his older brother, saying, âSorry bhaiya, I was rude to you, argued with you, disrespected you,â and thanked his mother for always standing by him. He asked her to continue supporting his father and brother.\n\nTo his father, he wrote, âSorry papa, I should have been a good person like you.â\n\nIn the most disturbing part of the note, he directly blamed the school. âI am sorry but St Columbaâs teachers have done this to me,â he said.\n\nHe added that his last wish was for action to be taken against those responsible: âSchool ki teachers abh hai hi esse kya boluâ¦ Meri last wish hai inke uper action le, me hi chata koi aur bacha meri tarah kuch kare (the school teachers are like this, what can I sayâ¦ My last wish is that action be initiated against them. I donât want any other child to take such a step).â\n\nShourya also wrote a phone number, asking whoever found the letter to call it. He ended the note with a request for organ donation, âIf any of my body works or is in condition to work kindly donate it to someone who really needs it.\n\nIn the FIR filed on Wednesday, his father, Pradeep Patil, named four staff members, the headmaster for classes 5 to 10, Aparajita Pal, and teachers Julie Varghese, Manu Kalra and Yukti Aggarwal Mahajan, accusing them of mentally harassing his son. Police have registered the case under sections 107 (abetment to suicide) and 3(5) (common intent) of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023.\n\nAlso read:Student suicides in India: An epidemic that is seeing a big spike\n\nShouryaâs father has claimed that the schoolâs headmaster and three teachers repeatedly picked on his son, scolding him for even the smallest mistakes and putting him under constant mental pressure.\n\nHe said that Shouryaâs friends had told the family that one of the teachers, Julie Varghese, had allegedly been threatening the boy for four days, warning that he would be expelled and given a transfer certificate.\n\nIn the FIR, he also stated that another teacher, Manu Kalra, had once pushed Shourya during class.\n\nThe father further alleged that on Tuesday, the day the teenager died, Shourya slipped during a dramatics class and was ridiculed by teacher Yukti Mahajan, who allegedly told him he was âoveracting.â\n\nHe said the scolding went on for so long and was so harsh that Shourya broke down in tears, only to be told that he could âcry as much as he wantedâ because it did not matter to her.\n\nSpeaking toNDTV, Pradeep Patil said, âThe teachers kept on torturing him…It is unimaginable to tell a student this just 10 days before the pre-board exams.â\n\nHe also toldPTI,âScolding is one thing, but constantly humiliating someone for even minute mistakes in front of everyone is unacceptable. The teachers were not just reprimanding, they were targeting, and this is being done with many of us.â\n\nThe Delhi government has ordered a high-level inquiry into the teenagerâs death, announcing the move on Thursday. The Directorate of Education set up a five-member committee, toldNDTVthat it was âimperativeâ to determine the facts, circumstances, and any administrative lapses linked to the incident.\n\nThe committee will be led by Joint Director Harshit Jain and has been instructed to carry out a detailed and impartial investigation. It has also been asked to submit its report within three days.\n\nMeanwhile, the schoolâs principal, Robert Fernandes, said the headmaster would be suspended until further notice. He added that the headmaster and the teachers named in the FIR must stay available for questioning and cannot enter the school premises or interact with students, staff, or parents without permission.\n\nTensions between China and Japan are escalating due to comments by Japanese PM Sanae Takaichi about Taiwan. China has retaliated by advising citizens not to travel to Japan, canceling flights, and banning Japanese seafood imports. Japan's tourism and trade sectors are expected to suffer significant economic losses due to China's punitive measures.\n\nGet the latest stories delivered straight to your inbox.",

        "title": "FSSAI orders nationwide removal of fruit juices and electrolyte drinks falsely sold as ‘ORS’",
        "content": "The Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has directed State and Union Territory food safety departments to immediately remove from sale all fruit-based beverages, ready-to-serve drinks, electrolyte drinks and similar products deceptively marketed with the term âORSâ on their labels, brand names or product descriptions.\n\nThe regulator issued the order on November 19 after noticing that several non-compliant beverages continue to be sold across retail outlets and online platforms despite earlier warnings.\n\nThe crackdown follows FSSAIâs October 2025 directives withdrawing permissions for food companies to use the term âORSâ,either as a standalone word or as a prefix or suffix on any product that does not conform to the World Health Organisationâs recommended Oral Rehydration Salts (ORS) formulation. WHO-compliant ORS products fall under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and are categorised as drugs, not foods.\n\nIn its latest order, FSSAI noted that multiple fruit-based beverages, energy drinks and electrolyte drinks were still being promoted as âORSâ or âORS-basedâ on e-commerce platforms, grocery stores, chemists, and modern retail chains. Such naming, the regulator said, violates the Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 because these drinks do not match the stringent composition of WHO-recommended ORS used for managing dehydration during diarrhoeal illnesses.\n\nTo curb this persistent malpractice, FSSAI has instructed all Designated Officers and field officials to conduct urgent inspection drives across online marketplaces and physical stores. Officials must identify non-compliant products and ensure they are âimmediately removed from saleâ, the order says. Regulatory action must also be initiated against the concerned food business operators (FBOs).\n\nAuthorities have been asked to submit a comprehensive Action Taken Report at the earliest, detailing inspections conducted, violations detected and corrective steps implemented, including product removals.\n\nThe regulator also expressed concern that some field officers had recently taken enforcement action even against legitimate WHO-recommended ORS (drug) products, wrongly treating them as part of the crackdown on misleading beverages. FSSAI reiterated that WHO-recommended ORS formulations are notified as drugs and lie outside FSSAIâs regulatory purview. Therefore, the October orders apply only to food and beverage products misusing the ORS terminology, not to actual ORS (drug) sachets approved under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act.\n\nField officers have been asked to exercise âdue diligenceâ during inspections and avoid sampling, seizure or disruption of genuine ORS products.\n\nThe misleading use of âORSâ by beverage brands has expanded rapidly in recent years, aided by online sales and aggressive marketing. Health experts have repeatedly warned that these drinks often contain sugar levels far exceeding WHOâs therapeutic ORS limits, lack the required electrolyte balance, and cannot treat dehydration in medical situations. Consumers, however, may mistake such drinks for medically approved ORS, posing potential health risks.\n\nFSSAIâs renewed intervention aims to prevent this confusion at a time when the consumption of flavoured hydration beverages and so-called electrolyte drinks is rising sharply.\n\nFSSAI has instructed all State Food Safety Commissioners and Central Licensing Authorities to prioritise enforcement at three levels:\n\n*Rapid verification drives across e-commerce platforms, pharmacies, supermarkets andkiranastores.\n\n*Immediate removal of products containing âORSâ in brand or product names.\n\n*Initiation of regulatory action against manufacturers and sellers in violation of the rules.\n\n*Retailers and online platforms have also been asked to ensure that beverages falsely marketed as ORS are delisted without delay.\n\nThe order stresses that misleading ORS-labelled beverages constitute âdeceptive practicesâ that violate food safety laws and may mislead vulnerable consumers seeking medically validated hydration solutions. By tightening enforcement, FSSAI aims to ensure that the term âORSâ remains associated only with WHO-compliant therapeutic formulations, safeguarding both public health and regulatory integrity.\n\nNIA arrested four more suspects in the November 10 Red Fort blast case, raising the total to six.
